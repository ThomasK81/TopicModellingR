Critics say that inflation is already running unacceptably high and there is a threat of much higher inflation in a year or two when the rebuilding of Christchurch begins to put pressure on limited resources. The Reserve Bank acknowledged these factors, but it has chosen instead to focus on the immediate impact of the earthquake on the economy and particularly on all-important business and consumer sentiment.

Context: Following the 22 Feburary earthquake in Christchurch, Canterbury Earthquake recovery Authority (CERA) divided the city into differently coloured zones determined by severity of land damage. Red for the properties too damaged to repair, orange was the colour of uncertainity, for properties that had to be further assessed to find out if they had to be demolished, and the blue zone had risk of liquefaction. Political parties are often linked to colours. The National Party is blue, Labour Party is red. Orange was associated with elections branding, and the Orange Guy cartoon character was used in the 2011 Referendum on the Voting System information campaign. The 2011 General Elections count for the Christchurch Central seat put Burns and Wagner in a dead heat, both polling 10,493 votes. On the recount, the seat went to Nicky Wagner with 12,064 votes.

Broughton took the Southern Sting to 10 successive national finals, winning seven, before guiding the Steel to the trans-Tasman semifinals twice. 'WELLYDONE' is a clever swipe at the controversy over the 'WELLYWOOD' sign that the Wellington Airport wants to put on a hill near the airport and that many people think is tacky and unimaginative.

Now that his name is saved Hughes is considering his future. The cartoon suggests that he may be redeemed but his future in Labour is compromised.

Context - The people of Libya have risen against their despotic leader Colonel Gaddafi, demanding that he stand down and that free and democratic elections be held. Unlike the leaders in both Tunisia and Egypt who held back against the popular uprisings and so there were comparatively few deaths and both leaders have in fact departed, Colonel Gaddafi has unleashed his military might against the rebels which has resulted in thousands of deaths and his starting to get the upper hand. Britain and the US appear to be at odds over the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya as the UK joined forces with France and Lebanon to press for a fresh UN security council resolution. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, played down the prospects of a no-fly zone when she declared that there were "other ways" to help the opposition as she warned against unilateral action. Hillary Clinton said "It is important to underscore that unilateral action is not an option. International action must be the route we take." The cautious stance of Clinton contrasted with Hague who raised the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone without authorisation from the UN. The foreign secretary told the Commons foreign affairs select committee: "Are there some circumstances in which countries have the right to act and it is legal even without a security council resolution? From all the legal advice I have received, there are circumstances." (Guardian 16 March 2011) The White House said on Tuesday (15 March) it was exploring ways to free up some of the billions of dollars of assets seized from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's government to provide help for the Libyan opposition. President Barack Obama also planned to meet his national security team on Tuesday (15 March) to discuss how to put more pressure on Gaddafi to step down. (Reuters 15 March 2011)

Critics say that inflation is already running unacceptably high and there is a threat of much higher inflation in a year or two when the rebuilding of Christchurch begins to put pressure on limited resources. The Reserve Bank acknowledged these factors, but it has chosen instead to focus on the immediate impact of the earthquake on the economy and particularly on all-important business and consumer sentiment.

The cartoon suggests that Phil Goff is a 'plonker' meaning 'someone who is a bit hopeless'. Phil Goff says New Zealand needed a bold vision and gutsy Budget and National failed on both counts. He also says the lackluster Budget tinkers and tampers but does no real good for New Zealanders. But if change is to happen Labour has to present an alternative vision that delivers more than a rehash of the old Labour standbys of more money for apprenticeship training, the reinstatement of research and development tax credits and reversing last year's tax cuts for high-income earners. Change will not happen if the perception remains that there is no alternative from Labour for John Key's optimism alone as a means to solve New Zealand's economic problems.

President Obama took to the airwaves in an effort to shift the debate. He called the recent weeks of negotiations over raising the debt ceiling a three-ring circus and asked the public to rally behind his effort to avoid a debt crisis, both temporarily and through the next presidential election.

Context - Winston Peters has announced that he is standing for parliament again but PM John Key has said that he will not be part of any Government that includes Winston Peters. "If Winston Peters holds the balance of power," Key said this week, "it will be a Phil Goff-led Labour government." But Labour is unlikely to embrace him either. Winston Peters has always courted controversy with his 'divisive demagoguery' and use of 'alarmist and inflammatory language'. (NZH editorial 6 February 2011)

Context - Tapping oil, gas and coal reserves has been made the top priority in the government's plans to develop energy supplies, sparking a furious response from environmentalists. The strategy, Developing Our Energy Potential, puts exploring ''petroleum and mineral fuel'' reserves - essentially oil, gas and coal - ahead of investing in renewable power sources and new technologies. The Green Party said the energy strategy "demonstrates how backwards-looking this government is on energy". (TVNZ 4 April 2011)

Context - 'Planking' is a new craze for young people in which they have to lie on something with their arms by their sides - the riskier the better - and then they post pictures on YouTube. The cartoon shows how the government still appears to be bouncing around at the top of the polls even after an uninspiring budget while Labour struggles to come up with sufficiently interesting policy to make any difference.

His claims terrified Cantabrians and led to people fleeing Christchurch. The 2011 budget will be announced in May and predictions are that it will be a cost-cutting one because of New Zealand's debt, partially caused by the Christchurch earthquakes.

The relative stability under the current autocratic regimes in these countries for several decades, which has been supported by the United States, has been very much in the interests of Israel. The cartoon suggests that Palestinians will take heart from the uprisings which does not bode well for Israel and there is a nice irony in the way Osama bin Laden and Mr Netanyahu are both perturbed by the rising of Arab people to overthrow old orders.

'LISTeria' is a (wordplay on 'hysteria') Context - refers to the news that the Labour Party has put at least seven newcomers into winnable slots on its list for this year's election, most of them with a union background. If Labour maintains the 34 per cent vote it received at the last election and keeps its current electorate seats, it will have about 22 list MPs, meaning all in the top 37 of the list get seats in Parliament. Phil Goff says that Damien O'Connor was wrong to blame the list process and the influence of union and rainbow sector groups for skewing the list against him and other rural and provincial-based candidates.

Context: The public has been complaining about the steep price of milk which is hard in economically challenged times. In March, the Commerce Commission began investigations into whether it should make a formal inquiry into the price of milk, under Part 4 of the Commerce Act, which regulates markets with little competition and little likelihood of an increase in competition. But Fonterra has now welcomed the Commerce Commission's decision not to make an inquiry into the price of milk. The Commission is, however, still investigating claims that dairy giant Fonterra is misusing its market power.

(NZH 12 July 2011) Greece has more than 350bn euros of debt, and the IMF warned last week than it needs an additional 100bn euros in aid on top of last year's bail-out to avoid a default. European governments are struggling to put together a second bailout of Greece that would supplement a 110 billion euro rescue launched in May last year. (BBC News 17 July 2011)

Nearby is a cup of tea in whose steam appears the head of Winston Peters, leader of New Zealand First as a genie. Context: The Act Party launched its campaign on Monday 14 November with ACT MP John Banks, who is running for the controversial Epsom seat, having a cup of tea with Prime Minister John Key. The event was widely publicised and the media were invited. The content of the chat, which was not intended to be public, was recorded by the media. John Key has complained to the police. He played right into the hands of Winston Peters who treated the tea party incident as a hot topic in a public meeting in Whangarei a couple of days later. The drubbing given to the PM by Winston Peters probably contributed to the excellent result or Peters in the election on the 26th November. He held his seat and took eight NZ First politicians with him into parliament. 'Cuppa haka' is a wordplay on 'kapa haka' which means something like 'Maori performing arts'.

But Fonterra has now welcomed the Commerce Commission's decision not to make an inquiry into the price of milk. The Commission is, however, still investigating claims that dairy giant Fonterra is misusing its market power.

In the foreground Prime Minister John Key bows before the queen. The cartoon suggests that PM John Key can continue to bow to the queen as though she is irrelevant to his 'brand of constitutional reform'. John Key promised a constitutional review in the Maori party's support deal; the review has stalled at high level by arguments over both the terms of reference (the Maori party wants wider ones than National) and who should be on the team. An example of John Key's brand of constitutional reform is Rodney Hide's drive for reform of the way laws are made. A second example is local government. The drivers are Hide as Local Government Minister, associate minister John Carter and Environment Minister Nick Smith. A third is co-governance and co-management in Treaty settlements, a radical shift brought about by Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Chris Finlayson - this limits regional councils and adds to their costs in money and time - viz Waikato River. Until very recently the Department of Conservation administered and managed that land on behalf of the nation of New Zealanders as a statutory duty. In a widening range of places it is now to share management. Next is the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

A bridge to Diamond Harbour!' And someone else says 'And somewhere to fish!' Context - Rubble from the earthquake may be used for the construction of watersides and bridges. This cartoon is a fanciful use for Christchurch earthquake rubble. Currently a ferry connects Diamond Harbour to Lyttelton, on the harbour's northern shore.

One of them wonders if 'he was planking' and the other says 'No! Exporting!' Context - Planking is a new craze among young people in which they take risks by lying face down with their arms at their sides on awkward and usually high surfaces - they then show an image on YouTube. However this man was not planking, he was 'exporting'. Refers to Merchandise trade surplus of $1.1 billion, or 24% of the value of exports for April. New Zealand's monthly goods trade surplus hit a record high for April as exports grew faster than imports, producing a trade surplus of $1.1 billion, when analysts were expecting just $600 million. The strength of the kiwi, which hit US81.76c yesterday, appears set to be further boosted by a combination of strong commodity prices and further weakening in the US dollar. The volatility thus created is a double-edged sword. (ODT 31 May 2011)

The interrogator says 'So, Prime Minister, we have reason to believe that you and your cronies are holding orgies in a castle outside Rome with teenage girls' An armed policeman stands in the background. Context - Silvio Berlusconi was sent for trial on vice charges and his supporters declared the indictment an onslaught on the will of the people. The trial, to start in April and be presided over by three women judges, is unparalleled in the modern history of Italy, and may make an early general election unavoidable. Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with an underage prostitute and abusing his office by seeking her release in another case. He denies both charges. Macri said that on 24 April last year the then 17-year-old Mahroug, known as Ruby Rubacuori (Ruby the Heartstealer), was dancing topless and a bit drunk round a pole in a specially equipped room at Berlusconi's home outside Milan. In a remark which may have been aimed at Italy's beleaguered prime minister, Pope Benedict XVI told an audience of police officers that public officials must "rediscover their spiritual and moral roots".

A full-blown default now looks like a realistic possibility. Greece was handed a bailout a year ago but the required austerity programme demanded as a condition of the bailout has hurt economic growth and sent unemployment up sharply causing Greece to miss some of the financial targets agreed to and triggering another round of cuts. A Greek default is now being openly described as Europe's "Lehman Brothers moment". That's because so much of its debt is held by European financial institutions. There is also the danger that contagion could again ripple out from Athens to Ireland and Portugal, which are already implementing their own austerity programmes in return for financial help.

The minister says that they need to make the Labour laws even more flexible because the employers want the workers to be able to bend over backwards for them. Context - New Employment law changes in New Zealand took effect 1 April and have given all employers the right to dismiss employees within a first 90-day "trial" period, with no rights to grievance procedure. This rule previously applied for small businesses of fewer than 20 employees. Now it applies in all workplaces, no matter the size of the workforce. The regressive changes also include restrictions on trade union access to a worksite, relaxation of fairness tests on dismissals, the ability of employers to bypass the union in collective negotiations, the possibility to exchange holiday days for money, the right to shift public holidays without payment, and the right for employers to demand a medical certificate for one day's sick leave. Prime Minister John Key has indicated National will campaign on further changes to labour laws - and will not rule out reinstating a youth minimum wage or changes to collective bargaining.

Featured in the advertisement are Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu who are singing a duet. Abbas sings 'There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us...' and Netanyahu continues 'We'll find a new way of living, we'll find a way of forgiving...' Context: Mahmoud Abbas has formally asked the United Nations to recognise a Palestinian state, defying intense US pressure to abandon the move. The Palestinian leader was greeted with extended applause as he told the UN general assembly that he was seeking recognition of a Palestinian state on land occupied by Israel since 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital because nearly two decades of peace negotiations had failed. (Guardian 23 September 2011) The cartoon is a spoof of the famous musical 'West Side Story.'

The vet says 'his pain is intolerable and he has absolutely no quality of life' but 'the good news is - he's not a close family member or anything like that.. so you're free to end his plight with love and dignity!' Context: the issue of euthanasia for humans is much in the news because of a case in Dunedin where Euthanasia campaigner Sean Davison's defence against a charge of attempted murder is that he would never try to murder his mother because he absolutely loved her. The cartoon highlights the irony of pets getting a much easier release from intolerable pain and illness than humans do.

A second version which lacks the title shows God saying 'Not the apple stuff Mr Jobs... forbidden fruit... it caused enough damage in the beginning.' Context: Steve Jobs died on the 5th of October 2011 of complications deriving from pancreatic cancer. There has always been keen competition between Apple and Microsoft which tend to have competing philosophies. Apple is secretive and Steve Jobs has said that getting ideas from focus groups doesn't work because people don't know what they want until it is shown to them. There is also the reference to the Biblical apple in the garden of Eden which first caused man to sin.

Well-managed refrigeration could help to improve the consistency of quality wines sold here and overseas, and allow the wine industry to cope with changes in supply and demand from year to year".

An adviser tells the minister that the PM wants him to justify spending 2 million on a waka made of plastic. The minister retorts angrily that he wouldn't have approved the spending had he known the fact, not that it was to be made of plastic but that it had to be justified. Context - The government has hit back at criticism over a $2 million venue centre in the shape of a waka for the Rugby World Cup (RWC), defending the cost as necessary to host a world-class event. Co-leader of the Maori Party Pita Sharples says the waka will promote Maori culture during the Rugby World Cup and at other events (like the America's Cup). Labour Party MP Shane Jones asks "How can Dr Sharples and Prime Minister John Key actually believe that this expensive indulgence is a positive advertisement for Maori? The truth is they don't but they're both working together in a desperate effort to keep the Maori Party afloat.

A newspaper in a rubbish bin nearby carries the headline 'Trump wants to be president. Context - Michelle Singletary writes in the Washington Post with Bloomberg Business section 'Trump, I don't believe the hype. You're fired'. She believes that he won't officially declare his candidacy because the Ethics in Government Act requires those running for federal office to file disclosures of their personal finances. The Huffington Post's Marcus Baram has reported on Trump's pattern of exaggerating his wealth. In a 2007 deposition, obtained by The Huffington Post and CNN, Trump was asked about his statements that his net worth was $8 billion. This is what Trump said: "I don't know. I don't think so. Well, maybe I'm adding $4 or $5 billion's worth, $3 billion, for the value of a brand. But I don't know." Forbes magazine puts Trump's net worth at $2.7 billion. The 'You're fired' comment refers to the talk-show game 'Celebrity Apprentice'; each week competing teams pitch their blueprints for America's future to the president-elect.

The United Nations have given NATO a command-and-control role, a development that allows an anxious US military to retreat to the sidelines. The countries involved in enforcing the zone had linked their participation to regional backing but Arab diplomatic solidarity endorsing military action wobbled on Sunday, when the league's secretary general, Amr Moussa, suggested early strikes on Muamar Gaddafi's military may have gone beyond their intended scope and could be imperilling civilians. However, in a meeting on Monday with the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, Moussa appeared to be back on board. An emergency meeting of the Arab League in Cairo on Tuesday looms as a crucial test of will for the regional body, which has been caught between a desire to see Colonel Gaddafi gone and reluctance to be seen to have the US, or Europe, do its bidding.

"Think we missed anything IMPORTANT?" ... 12 October 2011,A two-frame cartoon. The three 'Jitterati' realise that October 2011 is the end of 'IT' (the period of public consultation over the Wellington 2040 Strategy and Central City Framework plan) and wonder if they missed anything important. In the next frame (behind closed doors?), John Key is announcing that he will only talk about his cat, the intermittent pink rabbit of Buist's cartoons appears to offer no real choice concerning an ugly motorway flyover by Basin Reserve (a literal ugly man flies overhead), Cr McKinnon complains that he has been silenced, a seagull squawks that he should be doing something about it...all the while a penguin crawls up the wall.
The Wellington City Council's strategy for Wellington - 'Toward 2040: Smart green Wellington' - had closed its period of public consultation, and in October 2011, the revised draft had come up for adoption. The Government proved to be no help, the contentious proposal of the motorway flyover by the Basin Reserve had remained, accusations of gagging were being levelled at Council members, and the ratepayer (penguin?) was being driven up the wall. Public consultation appears to have been unimportant.

A second man says 'So nobody will get free access as there are no full-blooded Maori anymore'. They figure that the charges will be on a 'sliding scale of discounts depending on their mix'.

Context - Some people fear they will lose easy access to the beach as a result of the bill and others are very critical of the government's haste in pushing it through. The present government has repealed the Foreshore and Seabed Act and replaced it with legislation that removes the foreshore and seabed from Crown ownership andllows iwi to seek customary title to parts of it through the courts or through negotiation with the Government. The repealed Act is called the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill. There is criticism about the haste of the bill and anxiety about continued easy access to beaches. (NZH 9 February 2011)

Context - The Labour Party has put at least seven newcomers into winnable slots on its list for this year's election, most of them with a union background. If Labour maintains the 34 per cent vote it received at the last election and keeps its current electorate seats, it will have about 22 list MPs, meaning all in the top 37 of the list get seats in Parliament.

Underlying inflation pressures appear contained, as the first-quarter jump in the annual inflation rate to a 2-1/2-year high was largely driven by a rise in fuel prices and sales tax, giving the central bank plenty of leeway on policy.

One of the options presented to residents in the red zone, ideal for people with replacement policies, was the government bought your land, and you dealt directly with your insurers about your house. However they got a shock when insurers told them they won't replace their homes, they'll only repair them, even though they're earmarked for certain demolition.

He says to the woman at the reception desk 'The full treatment - I'm looking to emigrate to New Zealand.' Context: Margaret Mutu, head of Auckland University's Maori studies department, is standing by her claim in last weekend's Sunday Star-Times that immigrants from countries such as South Africa brought white supremacist attitudes with them.

The Race Relations office has received 30 complaints about Mutu's comments and there have been calls for her sacking, but the university is backing her right to free speech. Margaret Mutu says her comments about white immigration cannot be racist because she is not in a position of power. Race Relations Commissioner Joris de Bres earlier said there was no justification for anybody to discriminate on the basis of colour, race or national origin. He dismissed the idea that the ability to be racist depended on a person's position of power. (Stuff 7 September 2011)

The word 'Super-injunctions' appears top right of the screen. Context - Super injunctions prevent the media from reporting not only details of a story but even the existence of the injunction. They have their legal basis in the UK's 1998 Human Rights Act but have given rise to concerns of a creeping privacy law made by the courts and favouring the famous and wealthy. However, Twitter revelations of alleged attempts by British celebrities to cover up sexual indiscretions show that "super injunctions" to gag the press are unsustainable, according to lawyers.

A second version has the title 'The swim reaper'. Context - There have been a number of people hurt or frightened by stingrays in New Zealand recently. Sting rays are generally placid animals but occasionally a story hits the headlines as when Australian Steve Irwin died when a barb pierced his heart. A stingray's stinger is a long spine of venom-coated, serrated cartilage located at the base of the tail. A protective membrane or sheath covers the stinger. Usually, when a stingray's barb stabs a human, the entry pressure tears the sheath away allowing the sharp, serrated stinger to sink in to the flesh, releasing its venom. Although extremely painful, stingrays' venom isn't usually deadly. The few stingray deaths that have occurred around the world were mainly due to the flesh-tearing barb injecting directly into a major organ.

The worker holds a newspaper that reports 'Scientists give chill warnings on climate'. Context - Scientists opened a climate change conference in Wellington yesterday (31 March 2011) by stating that changes in climate being experienced around the globe were beyond their worst-case scenarios. The founding director of the Climate Change Research Institute, Martin Manning, said policy-makers needed to stop waiting for scientists to come up with answers about trends for the future, or definite measurements for how much sea levels or temperatures would rise by. Almost simultaneously, devastating floods battered Sir Lanka, Brazil and Queensland earlier this year. Professor Manning said policy-makers should start getting prepared for greater risks, instead of waiting for the lengthy process of scientists linking events together. "We can't wait till the scientists understand everything." (Stuff 1 April 2011) Employment law changes in New Zealand took effect 1 April have given all employers the right to dismiss employees within a first 90-day "trial" period, with no rights to grievance procedure. This rule previously applied for small businesses of fewer than 20 employees. Now it applies in all workplaces, no matter the side of the workforce. The regressive changes also include restrictions on trade union access to a worksite, relaxation of fairness tests on dismissals, the ability of employers to bypass the union in collective negotiations, the possibility to exchange holiday days for money, the right to shift public holidays without payment, and the right for employers to demand a medical certificate for one day's sick leave. There is nothing fair in the workplace law changes, according to ICEM-affiliated Engineering, Printing, and Manufacturing Union (EPMU).

However Leon Panetta, the CIA director, has confirmed that controversial "enhanced interrogation techniques" such as waterboarding yielded some of the intelligence information that ultimately led to Osama bin Laden.

Prince Salman is the eldest son of the current king of Bahrain, Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa and his first wife Queen Sabika bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa. He received an invitation to the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, an invitation that could prove awkward in light of his government's brutal treatment of mainly Shia pro-democracy protesters. In the event the Crown Prince of Bahrain will not be attending the royal wedding on Friday, Clarence House confirmed.

Context: Gold mining at the Coromandel town of Waihi could last until 2020 and beyond, thanks to a new exploration programme announced by mine operator Newmont Waihi Gold. It consists of two parts, the first being the Martha Exploration Project, a small underground exploration programme located entirely within the existing Martha mining licence area and the pit rim. This will require a variation to the existing Martha mining licence. The second part of the programme is Correnso, a potential underground mine in Waihi East which, if it proceeds, would replace the existing underground Favona and Trio mines. This will require consents under the Resource Management Act to go ahead.

They will also be eligible for a Government guaranteed bank loan for the rest, after the Government sealed a deal with the banks. But to be eligible for the payout, the claim must be lodged within 10 years of the home being built, meaning just 23,500 homes qualify out of an estimated 42,000 leaky homes. (TVNZ July 28 2011)

Underneath the text stand two women who furiously shout at each other, each holds an identical banner that reads 'Liberte, egalite, fraternite'. The difference is that one of the women wears a burqa and the other wears conventional casual clothing with no head covering. Context - On 11 April 2011 in France a new ban on wearing the burka in public came into force. French women now face fines and 'civic duty' guidance if they break the law, men who force their wives or daughters to wear burkas will face up to a year in prison, and fines of up to 25,000 pounds. French police said they will be enforcing the country's new burka ban "extremely cautiously" because of fears of provoking violence. Most of the women concerned by this law wear a niqab veil that reveals only their eyes, as opposed to a burqa, the full body covering worn by Afghan women. Many of the women believe this is about basic fundamental human rights and freedoms and some have held peaceful protests for the right "to dress as they please"...

Dairy jugrnaut Fonterra has dismissed a complaint to the Commerce Commission alleging it is artificially inflating the price of milk in New Zealand, saying even if it could manipulate a high price, it would not be making record profits if it did so. That's because the higher the price Fonterra gets for milk, the more it has to pay to its farmer-owners and the less it posts in profit, said chief financial officer Jonathan Mason. An official complaint to the commission claims New Zealand's biggest company, and controller of around 90 per cent of the country's raw milk supply, is setting an artificial, or notional, milk price in a "deliberate and measured campaign" to lessen competition in the New Zealand market.

In the second frame his chair is blasted across the floor by the force of the rage of the little Evans man who shouts 'FINE! - LET'S DO THAT! - Right after we discuss the rest of the country subsidizing farmers' ETS obligations!' Context - The dairy co-operative Fonterra announced the freeze on 19 February 2011 after widespread criticism that milk had become unaffordable for many families. Federated Farmers dairy spokesman Lachlan McKenzie today said he was surprised and confused by the move. "It won't cost Fonterra anything, it'll cost the owners and farmers that supply Fonterra. Farmers were not making as much money as some people thought, Mr McKenzie said. The price freeze came as Fonterra predicted a bonanza payout for the current dairy season of $7kg-$7.10/kg, with 10,463 farmers each expected to receive an average gross payout of more than $800,000. Some industry observers predict average payouts may be closer to $900,000. The high cost of milk came under severe criticism this week, with Northland's Manaia Health primary health organisation chief executive Chris Farrelly saying it was a national outrage that a country which produces 15 billion litres annually could not supply cheap milk to the domestic market. Fonterra and other dairy producers will have to pay a $40 million per annum "ETS tax bill" from 1 July this year - a cost that doubles to more than $80m in 2013. Many dairy farmers believe that the ETS tax is grossly unfair and fail to accept responsibility for the dairying gas emissions problem. (Timaru Herald 21 February 2011)

Another wrestler, representing 'Other faults' appears in the distance yelling 'Is it my turn yet?' Context - Christchurch has now had three major earthquakes and thousands of aftershocks. It now appears likely that the Christchurch quakes resulted from activity on a fault extending directly eastward from the Alpine fault that remained unknown until last year, says Roger Musson, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh. The new fault first came to light last September (4th) when a stronger but less calamitous quake shook Darfield, 40 kilometres west of Christchurch. Musson says the latest quake (Feb 22, 2011) probably resulted from an eastward continuation of activity on the same fault. "It has probably not moved for tens of thousands of years, so lots of strain built up," says Musson. The third major quake happened on 13th June 2011. (New Scientist - February 22, 2011)

Below is the word 'MILK' in large lettering and below that again is a boffin who says 'The noun has become a verb'. Context - Complaints about the high price of milk for New Zealanders. Dairy juggernaut Fonterra has dismissed a complaint to the Commerce Commission alleging it is artificially inflating the price of milk in New Zealand, saying even if it could manipulate a high price, it would not be making record profits if it did so. That's because the higher the price Fonterra gets for milk, the more it has to pay to its farmer-owners and the less it posts in profit, said chief financial officer Jonathan Mason. An official complaint to the commission claims New Zealand's biggest company, and controller of around 90 per cent of the country's raw milk supply, is setting an artificial, or notional, milk price in a "deliberate and measured campaign" to lessen competition in the New Zealand market.

The ACT Party now has both Roger Douglas, the creator of 'Rogernomics' the financial reforms in 1984 that introduced deregulation and a reliance on the markets for economic growth, and Don Brash who is a follower of that line of thinking. Their influence on the National Party in probable coalition arrangements will pull New Zealand further to the political right.

Allan Bollard the Governor of the Reserve Bank appears in gumboots asking if he can 'help with rebuilding..? by making an 'OCR cut'; he holds a collection box labeled 'OCR cut'. Context - Two earthquakes and hundreds of aftershocks have hit Christchurch, the first on 4 September 2010 and a second more devastating one on 22 February 2011. The Reserve Bank has made a relatively large 50-point cut in its benchmark interest rate, the Official Cash Rate (from 3% to 2.5 per cent). Critics say that inflation is already running unacceptably high and there is a threat of much higher inflation in a year or two when the rebuilding of Christchurch begins to put pressure on limited resources. The Reserve Bank acknowledged these factors, but it has chosen instead to focus on the immediate impact of the earthquake on the economy and particularly on all-important business and consumer sentiment.

One says 'They've put tsunami warning sirens along the coast' and the other says 'They'd better hurry up and stop the sewage spills too. A good-sized wave could dump it all back on them'. Context - the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on 11th March that caused several nuclear reactors to dangerously overheat and produce high radiation levels. Japan has invested heavily in technology to give advance warning for tsunamis and people are well drilled in procedures should a disaster strike. Water used to cool the overheated fuel rods in the damaged nuclear power plant becomes radioactive and although much of it is caught in storage tanks, some of it is flushed into the sea. So, as the cartoon suggests, another tsunami could flood the land with water contaminated with radioactivity.

It was demonstrating that things are almost back to normal after the foreign policy debacles of the Lange years. The so-called elephant in the room has been detusked. The rock in the road has been bulldozed aside. (Dominion Post 26 July 2011)

Context - The Labour Party has been suffering a series of problems that are very bad news for Phil Goff in the lead up to the 2011 election. And Moussa Koussa, the Libyan foreign minister, last night defected from Col Muammar Gaddafi's government after flying to Britain, telling officials he was "no longer willing" to serve the regime. Mr Koussa flew from Tunisia, where he had been on a diplomatic mission, and landed at Farnborough airport before being shuttled to London for immediate talks with high-ranking Foreign Office officials. Mr Koussa was one of the leading figures in Col Gaddafi's government and one of the architects of Libya's recent rehabilitation in the eyes of the international community. As such, his departure represents a significant scalp both for the coalition against Col Gaddafi and the rebels seeking his overthrow, and will fuel speculation that more defections could follow.

In the background are the walls of the Guantanamo Bay prison topped with barbed wire. Context - In his 2008 campaign for president, Barack Obama vowed to close (CBS) the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In March 2011, President Obama issued an executive order eliminating the two-year ban on military tribunals and establishing formal procedures for the review of cases in which detainees are being held indefinitely without trial. Of the 172 people who remain in the prison camp, 47 have been designated as indefinitely detainable. The 48th, Awal Gul, was repatriated from Guantanamo to his native Afghanistan in a coffin after dying of a heart attack on February 2. In his 21 May 2009 address from the National Archives, Obama explained that his administration had inherited a "legal mess" from the previous administration and that the challenges of dealing with detainees were more difficult than expected. In that speech, he explained that, contrary to his earlier promises and condemnations, military commissions were indispensable and indefinite detention may be necessary. What he meant but did not say was "politically necessary" to sustain his post-partisan aspirations. (Al jazeera 29 March 2011)

The minister tells a man that the government has decided that instead of introducing the ultra-fast Broadband, they will go for the cheaper option of 'thinband'. Context - The government plans to set up a Crown-owned fibre investment company to invest in companies which deliver fibre optics - reaching 75 percent of the population over 10 years. The government is committing up to $1.5 billion and expects it to be at least matched by private sector investment. Access to the country's new ultra-fast broadband network could cost up to $80 a month - but there may not be a huge breakthrough in speed, leaked documents reveal. The Herald has obtained a "price book" revealing the charges the Government expects on the fibre network, which will cost taxpayers $1.5 billion. The price book is a document given to potential internet providers and reveals the wholesale cost per month. Retail costs can be estimated by adding an 18 per cent retail margin as defined by the Commerce Commission previously, and GST. That would mean a moderate cost of between $47 and $80 per month for access, with speeds starting at double those on the present copper wire network. NZ Herald 23 March 2011)

He is responding to a reprimand from the speaker about dress codes. The reference is to Labour MP Clare Curran who arrived at the House wearing a Highlanders' blue and white shirt as a protest against a recent decision to change the colours to green and white. Prime Minister John Key has indicated National will campaign on further changes to labour laws - and will not rule out reinstating a youth minimum wage or changes to collective bargaining. Employment law changes in New Zealand took effect 1 April and have given all employers the right to dismiss employees within a first 90-day "trial" period, with no rights to grievance procedure. This rule previously applied for small businesses of fewer than 20 employees. Now it applies in all workplaces, no matter the size of the workforce. The regressive changes also include restrictions on trade union access to a worksite, relaxation of fairness tests on dismissals, the ability of employers to bypass the union in collective negotiations, the possibility to exchange holiday days for money, the right to shift public holidays without payment, and the right for employers to demand a medical certificate for one day's sick leave. There is nothing fair in the workplace law changes, according to ICEM-affiliated Engineering, Printing, and Manufacturing Union (EPMU).

Toilets have been a real problem after the earthquakes with thousands of chemical toilets and portaloos being shipped in - some people, however, use the old kiwi method of digging a long-drop in the back garden. The Reserve Bank has made a relatively large 50-point cut in its benchmark interest rate, the Official Cash Rate (from 3% to 2.5 per cent). Critics say that inflation is already running unacceptably high and there is a threat of much higher inflation in a year or two when the rebuilding of Christchurch begins to put pressure on limited resources. The Reserve Bank acknowledged these factors, but it has chosen instead to focus on the immediate impact of the earthquake on the economy and particularly on all-important business and consumer sentiment.

The minister tells reporters that 'our attempts at making motoring more affordable have hit a snag. We've developed a car that runs on milk. Context - Petrol prices rose another 3 cents per litre on 22 March and now 91 octane petrol prices have matched the peak price in July 2008 of $2.19/litre. The retail price of milk rose from $1.69 per litre last June to $1.82 in January but Agriculture Minister David Carter said it would be a bad decision for the Government to intervene to lower domestic prices. "We are dependent, as an export nation, on what we receive for our products internationally, and while that does have a negative, immediate impact on New Zealand consumers, frankly, the better the primary sector performs the better all New Zealanders will be," he said. Dairy giant Fonterra has frozen the price for the rest of the year. Manaia Health PHO Chief Executive Chris Farrelly has slammed the high cost of milk saying it is a national outrage that a country that produces 15 billion litres annually cannot supply cheap milk to the domestic market. "Milk is vital for children's health and bone development. Milk and milk products provide energy, protein, fats, vitamins and minerals. It should be seen as an essential food - not a luxury" says Mr Farrelly. The New Zealand Children's Nutrition survey shows that milk consumption has dropped by a third since the 1980s, replaced by soft drinks which are usually much cheaper.

The legislation, rushed through after 13 of the 17 accused from the Urewera raids had their cases thrown out because the secret filming surveillance used in evidence, was deemed illegal. The short term law change would allow police to use covert video evidence in about 50 ongoing investigations.

The Minister of Social Development, Paula Bennett, is shown in four cameos as the Cheshire cat from 'Alice in Wonderland'. The cat represents 'Minister Bennett's credibility'; in the first cameo it grins broadly, in the second the grin remains but the tail is disappearing, in the third there is just an outline of the cat but the grin is still there and in the last cameo just the grin remains holding between its teeth a card that reads 'Benefit card backtrack'.

Context: Under the Government's new youth welfare policy announced by Prime Minister John Key at the weekend, 16, 17 and 18-year-old beneficiaries would receive a payment card for food and clothes from approved stores.

The shopper asks 'Who does sell Tony Blair's book then'. Context - The employee assumes the woman wants the book written by Macsyna King and published by Ian Wishart about the deaths of her twin babies, Chris and Cru. Some bookstores have refused to stock the book on the grounds that Macsyna King might profit from sales. The person responsible has yet to be brought to justice. The cartoon makes a comparison with former British PM Tony Blair who agreed to send troops to Iraq to support the US effort, thereby being held responsible for the deaths of children in an ethically dubious war.

The Easter egg represents the 'Parole Board' and it says 'Freed dangerous crims? No worries we'll keep an eye on them' Context - The main function of the 42-strong New Zealand Parole Board is to make decisions about the release (or otherwise) of offenders eligible for parole. By law, the paramount consideration for the board in every case is the ``safety of the community'', but they are also bound to ensure offenders aren't detained any longer than is consistent with the safety of the community. Most prisoners serving a sentence over two years are entitled to a hearing each year after serving a third of their sentence, or their minimum non-parole period. (Sunday Star Times 27 March 2011) Probably refers specifically to the case John Gillies, 36, who was jailed for seven years in 2005 for assaulting two policemen and possessing cocaine and methamphetamine. He has 106 convictions, 34 of them for violence, including the 1993 screwdriver stabbing of Gisborne policeman Nigel Hendrikse. Gillies is to be released from prison, despite concerns about his propensity for violence.

But if the Government were to make such a declaration it would have the credibility of a chronic drunk swearing off the booze. Repeated bailouts have created an environment where poor decisions are not punished but rewarded. The AMI board and management need to account for their performance, and prudent insurers should benefit from an influx of customers. This is what is meant to happen in a capitalist economy.

Above the second cameo text reads 'Homophobic caveman found in Labour caucus' and below is Labour MP Damien O'Connor who says 'A gaggle of gays rule our party.

According to the Telegraph, the "gay caveman" was found buried in a way normally reserved only for women during the Copper Age. The man had been interred on his left side with his head facing east, with no weapons and household jugs -- almost always reserved for women in the region during that time -- placed at his feet. Traditionally, men were buried with weapons, hammers and flint knives, and their bodies were positioned on their right side with their heads facing west. (Huffington Post 7 April 2011) Labour MP Damien O'Connor has said sorry after lashing out about a "gaggle of gays" and "self-serving unionists" having too much control over the party. Hence a homosexual caveman and a homophobic caveman thousands of years apart.
