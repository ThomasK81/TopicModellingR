urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.1.1,thucydides an athenian wrote the history of the war between the peloponnesians and the athenians beginning at the moment that it broke out and believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it this belief was not without its grounds the preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the last state of perfection and he could see the rest of the hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel those who delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.1.2,indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history not only of the hellenes but of a large part of the barbarian world i had almost said of mankind
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.1.3,for though the events of remote antiquity and even those that more immediately precede the war could not from lapse of time be clearly ascertained yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was practicable leads me to trust all point to the conclusion that there was nothing on a great scale either in war or in other matters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.2.1,for instance it is evident that the country now called hellas had in ancient times no settled population on the contrary migrations were of frequent occurrence the several tribes readily abandoning their homes under the pressure of superior numbers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.2.2,without commerce without freedom of communication either by land or sea cultivating no more of their territory than the exigencies of life required destitute of capital never planting their land for they could not tell when an invader might not come and take it all away and when he did come they had no walls to stop him thinking that the necessities of daily sustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another they cared little for shifting their habitation and consequently neither built large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.2.3,the richest soils were always most subject to this change of masters such as the district now called thessaly boeotia most of the peloponnese arcadia excepted and the most fertile parts of the rest of hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.2.4,the goodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular individuals and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of ruin it also invited invasion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.2.5,accordingly attica from the poverty of its soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction never changed its inhabitants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.2.6,and here is no inconsiderable exemplification of my assertion that the migrations were the cause of there being no correspondent growth in other parts the most powerful victims of war or faction from the rest of hellas took refuge with the athenians as a safe retreat and at an early period becoming naturalized swelled the already large population of the city to such a height that attica became at last too small to hold them and they had to send out colonies to ionia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.3.1,there is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times before the trojan war there is no indication of any common action in hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.3.2,nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name on the contrary before the time of hellen son of deucalion no such appellation existed but the country went by the names of the different tribes in particular of the pelasgian it was not till hellen and his sons grew strong in phthiotis and were invited as allies into the other cities that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of hellenes though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.3.3,the best proof of this is furnished by homer born long after the trojan war he nowhere calls all of them by that name nor indeed any of them except the followers of achilles from phthiotis who were the original hellenes in his poems they are called danaans argives and achaeans he does not even use the term barbarian probably because the hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive appellation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.3.4,it appears therefore that the several hellenic communities comprising not only those who first acquired the name city by city as they came to understand each other but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people were before the trojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective action indeed they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained increased familiarity with the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.4.1,and the first person known to us by tradition as having established a navy is minos he made himself master of what is now called the hellenic sea and ruled over the cyclades into most of which he sent the first colonies expelling the carians and appointing his own sons governors and thus did his best to put down piracy in those waters a necessary step to secure the revenues for his own use
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.5.1,for in early times the hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and islands as communication by sea became more common were tempted to turn pirates under the conduct of their most powerful men the motives being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy they would fall upon a town unprotected by walls and consisting of a mere collection of villages and would plunder it indeed this came to be the main source of their livelihood no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement but even some glory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.5.2,an illustration of this is furnished by the honor with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder and by the question we find the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of voyagers are they pirates as if those who are asked the question would have no idea of disclaiming the imputation or their interrogators of reproaching them for it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.5.3,the same rapine prevailed also by land and even at the present day many parts of hellas still follow the old fashion the ozolian locrians for instance the aetolians the acarnanians and that region of the continent and the custom of carrying arms is still kept up among these continentals from the old piratical habits
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.6.1,the whole of hellas used once to carry arms their habitations being unprotected and their communication with each other unsafe indeed to wear arms was as much a part of everyday life with them as with the barbarians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.6.2,and the fact that the people in these parts of hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life was once equally common to all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.6.3,the athenians were the first to lay aside their weapons and to adopt an easier and more luxurious mode of life indeed it is only lately that their rich old men left off the luxury of wearing undergarments of linen and fastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers a fashion which spread to their ionian kindred and long prevailed among the old men there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.6.4,on the contrary a modest style of dressing more in conformity with modern ideas was first adopted by the lacedaemonians the rich doing their best to assimilate their way of life to that of the common people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.6.5,they also set the example of contending naked publicly stripping and anointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic exercises formerly even in the olympic contests the athletes who contended wore belts across their middles and it is but a few years since that the practice ceased to this day among some of the barbarians especially in asia when prizes for boxing and wrestling are offered belts are worn by the combatants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.6.6,and there are many other points in which a likeness might be shown between the life of the hellenic world of old and the barbarian of today
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.7.1,with respect to their towns later on at an era of increased facilities of navigation and a greater supply of capital we find the shores becoming the site of walled towns and the isthmuses being occupied for the purposes of commerce and defence against a neighbor but the old towns on account of the great prevalence of piracy were built away from the sea whether on the islands or the continent and still remain in their old sites for the pirates used to plunder one another and indeed all coast populations whether seafaring or not
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.8.1,the islanders too were great pirates these islanders were carians and phoenicians by whom most of the islands were colonized as was proved by the following fact during the purification of delos by athens in this war all the graves in the island were taken up and it was found that above half their inmates were carians they were identified by the fashion of the arms buried with them and by the method of interment which was the same as the carians still follow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.8.2,but as soon as minos had formed his navy communication by sea became easier as he colonized most of the islands and thus expelled the malefactors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.8.3,the coast populations now began to apply themselves more closely to the acquisition of wealth and their life became more settled some even began to build themselves walls on the strength of their newlyacquired riches for the love of gain would reconcile the weaker to the dominion of the stronger and the possession of capital enabled the more powerful to reduce the smaller towns to subjection
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.8.4,and it was at a somewhat later stage of this development that they went on the expedition against troy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.9.1,what enabled agamemnon to raise the armament was more in my opinion his superiority in strength than the oaths of tyndareus which bound the suitors to follow him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.9.2,indeed the account given by those peloponnesians who have been the recipients of the most credible tradition is this first of all pelops arriving among a needy population from asia with vast wealth acquired such power that stranger though he was the country was called after him and this power fortune saw fit materially to increase in the hands of his descendants eurystheus had been killed in attica by the heraclids atreus was his mother s brother and to the hands of his relation who had left his father on account of the death of chrysippus eurystheus when he set out on his expedition had committed mycenae and the government as time went on and eurystheus did not return atreus complied with the wishes of the mycenaeans who were influenced by fear of the heraclids besides his power seemed considerable and he had not neglected to court the favour of the populace and assumed the sceptre of mycenae and the rest of the dominions of eurystheus and so the power of the descendants of pelops came to be greater than that of the descendants of perseus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.9.3,to all this agamemnon succeeded he had also a navy far stronger than his contemporaries so that in my opinion fear was quite as strong an element as love in the formation of the confederate expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.9.4,the strength of his navy is shown by the fact that his own was the largest contingent and that of the arcadians was furnished by him this at least is what homer says if his testimony is deemed sufficient besides in his account of the transmission of the sceptre he calls him of many an isle and of all argos king hom il now agamemnon s was a continental power and he could not have been master of any except the adjacent islands and these would not be many but through the possession of a fleet and from this expedition we may infer the character of earlier enterprises
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.10.1,now mycenae may have been a small place and many of the towns of that age may appear comparatively insignificant but no exact observer would therefore feel justified in rejecting the estimate given by the poets and by tradition of the magnitude of the armament
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.10.2,for i suppose if lacedaemon were to become desolate and the temples and the foundations of the public buildings were left that as time went on there would be a strong disposition with posterity to refuse to accept her fame as a true exponent of her power and yet they occupy twofifths of peloponnese and lead the whole not to speak of their numerous allies without still as the city is neither built in a compact form nor adorned with magnificent temples and public edifices but composed of villages after the old fashion of hellas there would be an impression of inadequacy whereas if athens were to suffer the same misfortune i suppose that any inference from the appearance presented to the eye would make her power to have been twice as great as it is
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.10.3,we have therefore no right to be skeptical nor to content ourselves with an inspection of a town to the exclusion of a consideration of its power but we may safely conclude that the armament in question surpassed all before it as it fell short of modern efforts if we can here also accept the testimony of homer s poems in which without allowing for the exaggeration which a poet would feel himself licensed to employ we can see that it was far from equalling ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.10.4,he has represented it as consisting of twelve hundred vessels the boeotian complement of each ship being a hundred and twenty men that of the ships of philoctetes fifty by this i conceive he meant to convey the maximum and the minimum complement at any rate he does not specify the amount of any others in his catalogue of the ships that they were all rowers as well as warriors we see from his account of the ships of philoctetes in which all the men at the oar are bowmen now it is improbable that many supernumeraries sailed if we except the kings and high officers especially as they had to cross the open sea with munitions of war in ships moreover that had no decks but were equipped in the old piratical fashion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.10.5,so that if we strike the average of the largest and smallest ships the number of those who sailed will appear inconsiderable representing as they did the whole force of hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.11.1,and this was due not so much to scarcity of men as of money difficulty of subsistence made the invaders reduce the numbers of the army to a point at which it might live on the country during the prosecution of the war even after the victory they obtained on their arrival and a victory there must have been or the fortifications of the naval camp could never have been built there is no indication of their whole force having been employed on the contrary they seem to have turned to cultivation of the chersonese and to piracy from want of supplies this was what really enabled the trojans to keep the field for ten years against them the dispersion of the enemy making them always a match for the detachment left behind
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.11.2,if they had brought plenty of supplies with them and had persevered in the war without scattering for piracy and agriculture they would have easily defeated the trojans in the field since they could hold their own against them with the division on service in short if they had stuck to the siege the capture of troy would have cost them less time and less trouble but as want of money proved the weakness of earlier expeditions so from the same cause even the one in question more famous than its predecessors may be pronounced on the evidence of what it effected to have been inferior to its renown and to the current opinion about it formed under the tuition of the poets
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.12.1,even after the trojan war hellas was still engaged in removing and settling and thus could not attain to the quiet which must precede growth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.12.2,the late return of the hellenes from ilium caused many revolutions and factions ensued almost everywhere and it was the citizens thus driven into exile who founded the cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.12.3,sixty years after the capture of ilium the modern boeotians were driven out of arne by the thessalians and settled in the present boeotia the former cadmeis though there was a division of them there before some of whom joined the expedition to ilium twenty years later the dorians and the heraclids became masters of peloponnese so that much had to be done
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.12.4,and many years had to elapse before hellas could attain to a durable tranquillity undisturbed by removals and could begin to send out colonies as athens did to ionia and most of the islands and the peloponnesians to most of italy and sicily and some places in the rest of hellas all these places were founded subsequently to the war with troy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.13.1,but as the power of hellas grew and the acquisition of wealth became more an object the revenues of the states increasing tyrannies were by their means established almost everywhere the old form of government being hereditary monarchy with definite prerogatives and hellas began to fit out fleets and apply herself more closely to the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.13.2,it is said that the corinthians were the first to approach the modern style of naval architecture and that corinth was the first place in hellas where galleys were built
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.13.3,and we have ameinocles a corinthian shipwright making four ships for the samians dating from the end of this war it is nearly three hundred years ago that ameinocles went to samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.13.4,again the earliest seafight in history was between the corinthians and corcyraeans this was about two hundred and sixty years ago dating from the same time
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.13.5,planted on an isthmus corinth had from time out of mind been a commercial emporium as formerly almost all communication between the hellenes within and without peloponnese was carried on overland and the corinthian territory was the highway through which it travelled she had consequently great money resources as is shown by the epithet wealthy bestowed by the old poets on the place and this enabled her when traffic by sea became more common to procure her navy and put down piracy and as she could offer a mart for both branches of the trade she acquired for herself all the power which a large revenue affords
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.13.6,subsequently the ionians attained to great naval strength in the reign of cyrus the first king of the persians and of his son cambyses and while they were at war with the former commanded for a while the ionian sea polycrates also the tyrant of samos had a powerful navy in the reign of cambyses with which he reduced many of the islands and among them rhenea which he consecrated to the delian apollo about this time also the phocaeans while they were founding marseilles defeated the carthaginians in a seafight
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.14.1,these were the most powerful navies and even these although so many generations had elapsed since the trojan war seem to have been principally composed of the old fiftyoars and longboats and to have counted few galleys among their ranks
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.14.2,indeed it was only shortly before the persian war and the death of darius the successor of cambyses that the sicilian tyrants and the corcyraeans acquired any large number of galleys for after these there were no navies of any account in hellas till the expedition of xerxes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.14.3,aegina athens and others may have possessed a few vessels but they were principally fiftyoars it was quite at the end of this period that the war with aegina and the prospect of the barbarian invasion enabled themistocles to persuade the athenians to build the fleet with which they fought at salamis and even these vessels had not complete decks
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.15.1,the navies then of the hellenes during the period we have traversed were what i have described all their insignificance did not prevent their being an element of the greatest power to those who cultivated them alike in revenue and in dominion they were the means by which the islands were reached and reduced those of the smallest area falling the easiest prey
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.15.2,wars by land there were none none at least by which power was acquired we have the usual border contests but of distant expeditions with conquest for object we hear nothing among the hellenes there was no union of subject cities round a great state no spontaneous combination of equals for confederate expeditions what fighting there was consisted merely of local warfare between rival neighbors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.15.3,the nearest approach to a coalition took place in the old war between chalcis and eretria this was a quarrel in which the rest of the hellenic name did to some extent take sides
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.16.1,various too were the obstacles which the national growth encountered in various localities the power of the ionians was advancing with rapid strides when it came into collision with persia under king cyrus who after having dethroned croesus and overrun everything between the halys and the sea stopped not till he had reduced the cities of the coast the islands being only left to be subdued by darius and the phoenician navy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.17.1,again wherever there were tyrants their habit of providing simply for themselves of looking solely to their personal comfort and family aggrandizement made safety the great aim of their policy and prevented anything great proceeding from them though they would each have their affairs with their immediate neighbors all this is only true of the mother country for in sicily they attained to very great power thus for a long time everywhere in hellas do we find causes which make the states alike incapable of combination for great and national ends or of any vigorous action of their own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.18.1,but at last a time came when the tyrants of athens and the far older tyrannies of the rest of hellas were with the exception of those in sicily once and for all put down by lacedaemon for this city though after the settlement of the dorians its present inhabitants it suffered from factions for an unparalleled length of time still at a very early period obtained good laws and enjoyed a freedom from tyrants which was unbroken it has possessed the same form of government for more than four hundred years reckoning to the end of the late war and has thus been in a position to arrange the affairs of the other states not many years after the deposition of the tyrants the battle of marathon was fought between the medes and the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.18.2,ten years afterwards the barbarian returned with the armada for the subjugation of hellas in the face of this great danger the command of the confederate hellenes was assumed by the lacedaemonians in virtue of their superior power and the athenians having made up their minds to abandon their city broke up their homes threw themselves into their ships and became a naval people this coalition after repulsing the barbarian soon afterwards split into two sections which included the hellenes who had revolted from the king as well as those who had aided him in the war at the head of the one stood athens at the head of the other lacedaemon one the first naval the other the first military power in hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.18.3,for a short time the league held together till the lacedaemonians and athenians quarrelled and made war upon each other with their allies a duel into which all the hellenes sooner or later were drawn though some might at first remain neutral so that the whole period from the median war to this with some peaceful intervals was spent by each power in war either with its rival or with its own revolted allies and consequently afforded them constant practice in military matters and that experience which is learnt in the school of danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.19.1,the policy of lacedaemon was not to exact tribute from her allies but merely to secure their subservience to her interests by establishing oligarchies among them athens on the contrary had by degrees deprived hers of their ships and imposed instead contributions in money on all except chios and lesbos both found their resources for this war separately to exceed the sum of their strength when the alliance flourished intact
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.20.1,having now given the result of my inquiries into early times i grant that there will be a difficulty in believing every particular detail the way that most men deal with traditions even traditions of their own country is to receive them all alike as they are delivered without applying any critical test whatever
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.20.2,the general athenian public fancy that hipparchus was tyrant when he fell by the hands of harmodius and aristogiton not knowing that hippias the eldest of the sons of pisistratus was really supreme and that hipparchus and thessalus were his brothers and that harmodius and aristogiton suspecting on the very day nay at the very moment fixed on for the deed that information had been conveyed to hippias by their accomplices concluded that he had been warned and did not attack him yet not liking to be apprehended and risk their lives for nothing fell upon hipparchus near the temple of the daughters of leos and slew him as he was arranging the panathenaic procession
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.20.3,there are many other unfounded ideas current among the rest of the hellenes even on matters of contemporary history which have not been obscured by time for instance there is the notion that the lacedaemonian kings have two votes each the fact being that they have only one and that there is a company of pitane there being simply no such thing so little pains do the vulgar take in the investigation of truth accepting readily the first story that comes to hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.21.1,on the whole however the conclusions i have drawn from the proofs quoted may i believe safely be relied on assuredly they will not be disturbed either by the lays of a poet displaying the exaggeration of his craft or by the compositions of the chroniclers that are attractive at truth s expense the subjects they treat of being out of the reach of evidence and time having robbed most of them of historical value by enthroning them in the region of legend turning from these we can rest satisfied with having proceeded upon the clearest data and having arrived at conclusions as exact as can be expected in matters of such antiquity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.21.2,to come to this war despite the known disposition of the actors in a struggle to overrate its importance and when it is over to return to their admiration of earlier events yet an examination of the facts will show that it was much greater than the wars which preceded it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.22.1,with reference to the speeches in this history some were delivered before the war began others while it was going on some i heard myself others i got from various quarters it was in all cases difficult to carry them word for word in one s memory so my habit has been to make the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what they really said
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.22.2,and with reference to the narrative of events far from permitting myself to derive it from the first source that came to hand i did not even trust my own impressions but it rests partly on what i saw myself partly on what others saw for me the accuracy of the report being always tried by the most severe and detailed tests possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.22.3,my conclusions have cost me some labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the same occurrences by different eyewitnesses arising sometimes from imperfect memory sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.22.4,the absence of romance in my history will i fear detract somewhat from its interest but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it i shall be content in fine i have written my work not as an essay which is to win the applause of the moment but as a possession for all time
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.23.1,the median war the greatest achievement of past times yet found a speedy decision in two actions by sea and two by land the peloponnesian war was prolonged to an immense length and long as it was it was short without parallel for the misfortunes that it brought upon hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.23.2,never had so many cities been taken and laid desolate here by the barbarians here by the parties contending the old inhabitants being sometimes removed to make room for others never was there so much banishing and bloodshedding now on the field of battle now in the strife of action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.23.3,old stories of occurrences handed down by tradition but scantily confirmed by experience suddenly ceased to be incredible there were earthquakes of unparalleled extent and violence eclipses of the sun occurred with a frequency unrecorded in previous history there were great droughts in sundry places and consequent famines and that most calamitous and awfully fatal visitation the plague all this came upon them with the late war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.23.4,which was begun by the athenians and peloponnesians by the dissolution of the thirty years truce made after the conquest of euboea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.23.5,to the question why they broke the treaty i answer by placing first an account of their grounds of complaint and points of difference that no one may ever have to ask the immediate cause which plunged the hellenes into a war of such magnitude
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.23.6,the real cause i consider to be the one which was formally most kept out of sight the growth of the power of athens and the alarm which this inspired in lacedaemon made war inevitable still it is well to give the grounds alleged by either side which led to the dissolution of the treaty and the breaking out of the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.1,the city of epidamnus stands on the right of the entrance of the ionic gulf its vicinity is inhabited by the taulantians an illyrian people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.2,the place is a colony from corcyra founded by phalius son of eratocleides of the family of the heraclids who had according to ancient usage been summoned for the purpose from corinth the mother country the colonists were joined by some corinthians and others of the dorian race
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.3,now as time went on the city of epidamnus became great and populous
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.4,but falling a prey to factions arising it is said from a war with her neighbors the barbarians she became much enfeebled and lost a considerable amount of her power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.5,the last act before the war was the expulsion of the nobles by the people the exiled party joined the barbarians and proceeded to plunder those in the city by sea and land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.6,and the epidamnians finding themselves hard pressed sent ambassadors to corcyra beseeching their mother country not to allow them to perish but to make up matters between them and the exiles and to rid them of the war with the barbarians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.24.7,the ambassadors seated themselves in the temple of hera as suppliants and made the above requests to the corcyraeans but the corcyraeans refused to accept their supplication and they were dismissed without having effected anything
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.25.1,when the epidamnians found that no help could be expected from corcyra they were in a strait what to do next so they sent to delphi and inquired of the god whether they should deliver their city to the corinthians and endeavor to obtain some assistance from their founders the answer he gave them was to deliver the city and place themselves under corinthian protection
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.25.2,so the epidamnians went to corinth and delivered over the colony in obedience to the commands of the oracle they showed that their founder came from corinth and revealed the answer of the god and they begged them not to allow them to perish but to assist them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.25.3,this the corinthians consented to do believing the colony to belong as much to themselves as to the corcyraeans they felt it to be a kind of duty to undertake their protection besides they hated the corcyraeans for their contempt of the mother country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.25.4,instead of meeting with the usual honors accorded to the parent city by every other colony at public assemblies such as precedence at sacrifices corinth found herself treated with contempt by a power which in point of wealth could stand comparison with any even of the richest communities in hellas which possessed great military strength and which sometimes could not repress a pride in the high naval position of an island whose nautical renown dated from the days of its old inhabitants the phaeacians this was one reason of the care that they lavished on their fleet which became very efficient indeed they began the war with a force of a hundred and twenty galleys
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.26.1,all these grievances made corinth eager to send the promised aid to epidamnus advertisement was made for volunteer settlers and a force of ambraciots leucadians and corinthians was despatched
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.26.2,they marched by land to apollonia a corinthian colony the route by sea being avoided from fear of corcyraean interruption
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.26.3,when the corcyraeans heard of the arrival of the settlers and troops in epidamnus and the surrender of the colony to corinth they took fire instantly putting to sea with fiveandtwenty ships which were quickly followed by others they insolently commanded the epidamnians to receive back the banished nobles it must be premised that the epidamnian exiles had come to corcyra and pointing to the sepulchres of their ancestors had appealed to their kindred to restore them and to dismiss the corinthian garrison and settlers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.26.4,but to all this the epidamnians turned a deaf ear upon this the corcyraeans commenced operations against them with a fleet of forty sail they took with them the exiles with a view to their restoration and also secured the services of the illyrians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.26.5,sitting down before the city they issued a proclamation to the effect that any of the natives that chose and the foreigners might depart unharmed with the alternative of being treated as enemies on their refusal the corcyraeans proceeded to besiege the city which stands on an isthmus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.27.1,and the corinthians receiving intelligence of the investment of epidamnus got together an armamentand proclaimed a colony to epidamnus perfect political equality being guaranteed to all who chose to go any who were not prepared to sail at once might by paying down the sum of fifty corinthian drachmae have a share in the colony without leaving corinth great numbers took advantage of this proclamation some being ready to start directly others paying the requisite forfeit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.27.2,in case of their passage being disputed by the corcyraeans several cities were asked to lend them a convoy megara prepared to accompany them with eight ships pale in cephallonia with four epidaurus furnished five hermione one troezen two leucas ten and ambracia eight the thebans and phliasians were asked for money the eleans for hulls as well while corinth herself furnished thirty ships and three thousand heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.28.1,when the corcyraeans heard of their preparations they came to corinth with envoys from lacedaemon and sicyon whom they persuaded to accompany them and bade her recall the garrison and settlers as she had nothing to do with epidamnus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.28.2,if however she had any claims to make they were willing to submit the matter to the arbitration of such of the cities in peloponnese as should be chosen by mutual agreement and that the colony should remain with the city to whom the arbitrators might assign it they were also willing to refer the matter to the oracle at delphi
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.28.3,if in defiance of their protestations war was appealed to they should be themselves compelled by this violence to seek friends in quarters where they had no desire to seek them and to make even old ties give way to the necessity of assistance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.28.4,the answer they got from corinth was that if they would withdraw their fleet and the barbarians from epidamnus negotiation might be possible but while the town was still being besieged going before arbitrators was out of the question
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.28.5,the corcyraeans retorted that if corinth would withdraw her troops from epidamnus they would withdraw theirs or they were ready to let both parties remain in status quo an armistice being concluded till judgment could be given
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.29.1,turning a deaf ear to all these proposals when their ships were manned and their allies had come in the corinthians sent a herald before them to declare war and getting under weigh with seventyfive ships and two thousand heavy infantry sailed for epidamnus to give battle to the corcyraeans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.29.2,the fleet was under the command of aristeus son of pellichas callicrates son of callias and timanor son of timanthes the troops under that of archetimus son of eurytimus and isarchidas son of isarchus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.29.3,when they had reached actium in the territory of anactorium at the mouth of the gulf of ambracia where the temple of apollo stands the corcyraeans sent on a herald in a light boat to warn them not to sail against them meanwhile they proceeded to man their ships all of which had been equipped for action the old vessels being undergirded to make them seaworthy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.29.4,on the return of the herald without any peaceful answer from the corinthians their ships being now manned they put out to sea to meet the enemy with a fleet of eighty sail forty were engaged in the siege of epidamnus formed line and went into action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.29.5,and gained a decisive victory and destroyed fifteen of the corinthian vessels the same day had seen epidamnus compelled by its besiegers to capitulate the conditions being that the foreigners should be sold and the corinthians kept as prisoners of war till their fate should be otherwise decided
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.30.1,after the engagement the corcyraeans set up a trophy on leukimme a headland of corcyra and slew all their captives except the corinthians whom they kept as prisoners of war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.30.2,defeated at sea the corinthians and their allies repaired home and left the corcyraeans masters of all the sea about those parts sailing to leucas a corinthian colony they ravaged their territory and burnt cyllene the harbor of the eleans because they had furnished ships and money to corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.30.3,for almost the whole of the period that followed the battle they remained masters of the sea and the allies of corinth were harassed by corcyraean cruisers at last corinth roused by the sufferings of her allies sent out ships and troops in the fall of the summer who formed an encampment at actium and about chimerium in thesprotis for the protection of leucas and the rest of the friendly cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.30.4,the corcyraeans on their part formed a similar station on leukimme neither party made any movement but they remained confronting each other till the end of the summer and winter was at hand before either of them returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.31.1,corinth exasperated by the war with the corcyraeans spent the whole of the year after the engagement and that succeeding it in building ships and in straining every nerve to form an efficient fleet rowers being drawn from peloponnese and the rest of hellas by the inducement of large bounties
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.31.2,the corcyraeans alarmed at the news of their preparations being without a single ally in hellas for they had not enrolled themselves either in the athenian or in the lacedaemonian confederacy decided to repair to athens in order to enter into alliance and to endeavor to procure support from her
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.31.3,corinth also hearing of their intentions sent an embassy to athens to prevent the corcyraean navy being joined by the athenian and her prospect of ordering the war according to her wishes being thus impeded
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.31.4,an assembly was convoked and the rival advocates appeared the corcyraeans spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.32.1,athenians when a people that have not rendered any important service or support to their neighbors in times past for which they might claim to be repaid appear before them as we now appear before you to solicit their assistance they may fairly be required to satisfy certain preliminary conditions they should show first that it is expedient or at least safe to grant their request next that they will retain a lasting sense of the kindness but if they cannot clearly establish any of these points they must not be annoyed if they meet with a rebuff
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.32.2,now the corcyraeans believe that with their petition for assistance they can also give you a satisfactory answer on these points and they have therefore despatched us hither
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.32.3,it has so happened that our policy as regards you with respect to this request turns out to be inconsistent and as regards our interests to be at the present crisis inexpedient
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.32.4,we say inconsistent because a power which has never in the whole of her past history been willing to ally herself with any of her neighbors is now found asking them to ally themselves with her and we say inexpedient because in our present war with corinth it has left us in a position of entire isolation and what once seemed the wise precaution of refusing to involve ourselves in alliances with other powers lest we should also involve ourselves in risks of their choosing has now proved to be folly and weakness
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.32.5,it is true that in the late naval engagement we drove back the corinthians from our shores singlehanded but they have now got together a still larger armament from peloponnese and the rest of hellas and we seeing our utter inability to cope with them without foreign aid and the magnitude of the danger which subjection to them implies find it necessary to ask help from you and from every other power and we hope to be excused if we forswear our old principle of complete political isolation a principle which was not adopted with any sinister intention but was rather the consequence of an error in judgment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.33.1,now there are many reasons why in the event of your compliance you will congratulate yourselves on this request having been made to you first because your assistance will be rendered to a power which herself inoffensive is a victim to the injustice of others secondly because all that we most value is at stake in the present contest and your welcome of us under these circumstances will be a proof of good will which will ever keep alive the gratitude you will lay up in our hearts thirdly yourselves excepted we are the greatest naval power in hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.33.2,moreover can you conceivea stroke of good fortune more rare in itself or more disheartening to your enemies than that the power whose adhesion you would have valued above much material and moral strength should present herself selfinvited should deliver herself into your hands without danger and without expense and should lastly put you in the way of gaining a high character in the eyes of the world the gratitude of those whom you shall assist and a great accession of strength for yourselves you may search all history without finding many instances of a people gaining all these advantages at once or many instances of a power that comes in quest of assistance being in a position to give to the people whose alliance she solicits as much safety and honor as she will receive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.33.3,but it will be urged that it is only in the case of a war that we shall be found useful to this we answer that if any of you imagine that the war is far off he is grievously mistaken and is blind to the fact that lacedaemon regards you with jealousy and desires war and that corinth is powerful there the same remember that is your enemy and is even now trying to subdue us as a preliminary to attacking you and this she does to prevent our becoming united by a common enmity and her having us both on her hands and also to insure getting the start of you in one of two ways either by crippling our power or by making its strength her own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.33.4,now it is our policy to be beforehand with her that is for corcyra to make an offer of alliance and for you to accept it in fact we ought to form plans against her instead of waiting to defeat the plans she forms against us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.34.1,if she asserts that for you to receive a colony of hers into alliance is not right let her know that every colony that is well treated honors its parent state but becomes estranged from it by injustice for colonists are not sent forth on the understanding that they are to be the slaves of those that remain behind but that they are to be their equals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.34.2,and that corinth was injuring us is clear invited to refer the dispute about epidamnus to arbitration they chose to prosecute their complaints by war rather than by a fair trial
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.34.3,and let their conduct towards us who are their kindred be a warning to you not to be misled by their deceit nor to yield to their direct requests concessions to adversaries only end in selfreproach and the more strictly they are avoided the greater will be the chance of security
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.35.1,if it be urged that your reception of us will be a breach of the treaty existing between you and lacedaemon the answer is that we are a neutral state
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.35.2,and that one of the express provisions of that treaty is that it shall be competent for any hellenic state that is neutral to join whichever side it pleases
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.35.3,and it is intolerable for corinth to be allowed to obtain men for her navy not only from her allies but also from the rest of hellas no small number being furnished by your own subjects while we are to be excluded both from the alliance left open to us by treaty and from any assistance that we might get from other quarters and you are to be accused of political immorality if you comply with our request
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.35.4,on the other hand we shall have much greater cause to complain of you if you do not comply with it if we who are in peril and are no enemies of yours meet with a repulse at your hands while corinth who is the aggressor and your enemy not only meets with no hindrance from you but is even allowed to draw material for war from your dependencies this ought not to be but you should either forbid her enlisting men in your dominions or you should lend us too what help you may think advisable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.35.5,but your real policy is to afford us avowed countenance and support the advantages of this course as we premised in the beginning of our speech are many we mention one that is perhaps the chief could there be a clearer guarantee of our good faith than is offered by the fact that the power which is at enmity with you is also at enmity with us and that that power is fully able to punish defection and there is a wide difference between declining the alliance of an inland and of a maritime power for your first endeavor should be to prevent if possible the existence of any naval power except your own failing this to secure the friendship of the strongest that does exist
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.36.1,and if any of you believe that what we urge is expedient but fear to act upon this belief lest it should lead to a breach of the treaty you must remember that on the one hand whatever your fears your strength will be formidable to your antagonists on the other whatever the confidence you derive from refusing to receive us your weakness will have no terrors for a strong enemy you must also remember that your decision is for athens no less than for corcyra and that you are not making the best provision for her interests if at a time when you are anxiously scanning the horizon that you may be in readiness for the breaking out of the war which is all but upon you you hesitate to attach to your side a place whose adhesion or estrangement is alike pregnant with the most vital consequences
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.36.2,for it lies conveniently for the coastnavigation in the direction of italy and sicily being able to bar the passage of naval reinforcements from thence to peloponnese and from peloponnese thither and it is in other respects a most desirable station
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.36.3,to sum up as shortly as possible embracing both general and particular considerations let this show you the folly of sacrificing us remember that there are but three considerable naval powers in hellas athens corcyra and corinth and that if you allow two of these three to become one and corinth to secure us for herself you will have to hold the sea against the united fleets of corcyra and peloponnese but if you receive us you will have our ships to reinforce you in the struggle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.36.4,such were the words of the corcyraeans after they had finished the corinthians spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.37.1,these corcyraeans in the speech we have just heard do not confine themselves to the question of their reception into your alliance they also talk of our being guilty of injustice and their being the victims of an unjustifiable war it becomes necessary for us to touch upon both these points before we proceed to the rest of what we have to say that you may have a more correct idea of the grounds of our claim and have good cause to reject their petition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.37.2,according to them their old policy of refusing all offers of alliance was a policy of moderation it was in fact adopted for bad ends not for good indeed their conduct is such as to make them by no means desirous of having allies present to witness it or of having the shame of asking their concurrence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.37.3,besides their geographical situation makes them independent of others and consequently the decision in cases where they injure any lies not with judges appointed by mutual agreement but with themselves because while they seldom make voyages to their neighbors they are constantly being visited by foreign vessels which are compelled to put in to corcyra
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.37.4,in short the object that they propose to themselves in their specious policy of complete isolation is not to avoid sharing in the crimes of others but to secure a monopoly of crime to themselves the license of outrage wherever they can compel of fraud wherever they can elude and the enjoyment of their gains without shame
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.37.5,and yet if they were the honest men they pretend to be the less hold that others had upon them the stronger would be the light in which they might have put their honesty by giving and taking what was just
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.38.1,but such has not been their conduct either towards others or towards us the attitude of our colony towards us has always been one of estrangement and is now one of hostility for say they we were not sent out to be illtreated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.38.2,we rejoin that we did not found the colony to be insulted by them but to be their head and to be regarded with a proper respect
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.38.3,at any rate our other colonies honor us and we are very much beloved by our colonists
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.38.4,and clearly if the majority are satisfied with us these can have no good reason for a dissatisfaction in which they stand alone and we are not acting improperly in making war against them nor are we making war against them without having received signal provocation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.38.5,besides if we were in the wrong it would be honorable in them to give way to our wishes and disgraceful for us to trample on their moderation but in the pride and license of wealth they have sinned again and again against us and never more deeply than when epidamnus our dependency which they took no steps to claim in its distress upon our coming to relieve it was by them seized and is now held by force of arms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.39.1,as to their allegation that they wished the question to be first submitted to arbitration it is obvious that a challenge coming from the party who is safe in a commanding position cannot gain the credit due only to him who before appealing to arms in deeds as well as words places himself on a level with his adversary
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.39.2,in their case it was not before they laid siege to the place but after they at length understood that we should not tamely suffer it that they thought of the specious word arbitration and not satisfied with their own misconduct there they appear here now requiring you to join with them not in alliance but in crime and to receive them in spite of their being at enmity with us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.39.3,but it was when they stood firmest that they should have made overtures to you and not at a time when we have been wronged and they are in peril nor yet at a time when you will be admitting to a share in your protection those who never admitted you to a share in their power and will be incurring an equal amount of blame from us with those in whose offences you had no hand no they should have shared their power with you before they asked you to share your fortunes with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.40.1,so then the reality of the grievances we come to complain of and the violence and rapacity of our opponents have both been proved but that you cannot equitably receive them this you have still to learn
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.40.2,it may be true that one of the provisions of the treaty is that it shall be competent for any state whose name was not down on the list to join whichever side it pleases but this agreement is not meant for those whose object in joining is the injury of other powers but for those whose need of support does not arise from the fact of defection and whose adhesion will not bring to the power that is mad enough to receive them war instead of peace which will be the case with you if you refuse to listen to us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.40.3,for you cannot become their auxiliary and remain our friend if you join in their attack you must share the punishment which the defenders inflict on them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.40.4,and yet you have the best possible right to be neutral or failing this you should on the contrary join us against them corinth is at least in treaty with you with corcyra you were never even in truce but do not lay down the principle that defection is to be patronized
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.40.5,did we on the defection of the samians record our vote against you when the rest of the peloponnesian powers were equally divided on the question whether they should assist them no we told them to their face that every power has a right to punish its own allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.40.6,why if you make it your policy to receive and assist all offenders you will find that just as many of your dependencies will come over to us and the principle that you establish will press less heavily on us than on yourselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.41.1,this then is what hellenic law entitles us to demand as a right but we have also advice to offer and claims on your gratitude which since there is no danger of our injuring you as we are not enemies and since our friendship does not amount to very frequent intercourse we say ought to be liquidated at the present juncture
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.41.2,when you were in want of ships of war for the war against the aeginetans before the persian invasion corinth supplied you with twenty vessels that good turn and the line we took on the samian question when we were the cause of the peloponnesians refusing to assist them enabled you to conquer aegina and to punish samos and we acted thus at crises when if ever men are wont in their efforts against their enemies to forget everything for the sake of victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.41.3,regarding him who assists them then as a friend even if thus far he has been a foe and him who opposes them then as a foe even if he has thus far been a friend indeed they allow their real interests to suffer from their absorbing preoccupation in the struggle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.42.1,weigh well these considerations and let your youth learn what they are from their elders and let them determine to do unto us as we have done unto you and let them not acknowledge the justice of what we say but dispute its wisdom in the contingency of war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.42.2,not only is the straightest path generally speaking the wisest but the coming of the war which the corcyraeans have used as a bugbear to persuade you to do wrong is still uncertain and it is not worth while to be carried away by it into gaining the instant and declared enmity of corinth it were rather wise to try and counteract the unfavorable impression which your conduct to megara has created

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.42.4,and do not be seduced by the prospect of a great naval alliance abstinence from all injustice to other firstrate powers is a greater tower of strength than anything that can be gained by the sacrifice of permanent tranquillity for an apparent temporary advantage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.43.1,it is now our turn to benefit by the principle that we laid down at lacedaemon that every power has a right to punish her own allies we now claim to receive the same from you and protest against your rewarding us for benefiting you by our vote by injuring us by yours

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.43.3,and for these corcyraeans neither receive them into alliance in our despite nor be their abettors in crime
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.43.4,so do and you will act as we have a right to expect of you and at the same time best consult your own interest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.44.1,such were the words of the corinthians when the athenians had heard both out two assemblies were held in the first there was a manifest disposition to listen to the representations of corinth in the second public feeling had changed and an alliance with corcyra was decided on with certain reservations it was to be a defensive not an offensive alliance it did not involve a breach of the treaty with peloponnese athens could not be required to join corcyra in any attack upon corinth but each of the contracting parties had a right to the other s assistance against invasion whether of his own territory or that of an ally
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.44.2,for it began now to be felt that the coming of the peloponnesian war was only a question of time and no one was willing to see a naval power of such magnitude as corcyra sacrificed to corinth though if they could let them weaken each other by mutual conflict it would be no bad preparation for the struggle which athens might one day have to wage with corinth and the other naval powers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.44.3,at the same time the island seemed to lie conveniently on the coasting passage to italy and sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.45.1,with these views athens received corcyra into alliance and on the departure of the corinthians not long afterwards sent ten ships to their assistance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.45.2,they were commanded by lacedaemonius the son of cimon diotimus the son of strombichus and porteas the son of epicles
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.45.3,their instructions were to avoid collision with the corinthian fleet except under certain circumstances if it sailed to corcyra and threatened a landing on her coast or in any of her possessions they were to do their utmost to prevent it these instructions were prompted by an anxiety to avoid a breach of the treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.46.1,meanwhile the corinthians completed their preparations and sailed for corcyra with a hundred and fifty ships of these elis furnished ten megara twelve leucas ten ambracia twentyseven anactorium one and corinth herself ninety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.46.2,each of these contingents had its own admiral the corinthian being under the command of xenoclides son of euthycles with four colleagues
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.46.3,sailing from leucas they made land at the part of the continent opposite corcyra
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.46.4,they anchored in the harbor of chimerium in the territory of thesprotis above which at some distance from the sea lies the city of ephyre in the elean district by this city the acherusian lake pours its waters into the sea it gets its name from the river acheron which flows through thesprotis and falls into the lake there also the river thyamis flows forming the boundary between thesprotis and kestrine and between these rivers rises the point of chimerium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.46.5,in this part of the continent the corinthians now came to anchor and formed an encampment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.47.1,when the corcyraeans saw them coming they manned a hundred and ten ships commanded by meikiades aisimides and eurybatus and stationed themselves at one of the sybota isles the ten athenian ships being present
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.47.2,on point leukimme they posted their land forces and a thousand heavy infantry who had come from zacynthus to their assistance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.47.3,nor were the corinthians on the mainland without their allies the barbarians flocked in large numbers to their assistance the inhabitants of this part of the continent being old allies of theirs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.48.1,when the corinthian preparations were completed they took three days provisions and put out from chimerium by night ready for action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.48.2,sailing with the dawn they sighted the corcyraean fleet out at sea and coming towards them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.48.3,when they perceived each other both sides formed in order of battle on the corcyraean right wing lay the athenian ships the rest of the line being occupied by their own vessels formed in three squadrons each of which was commanded by one of the three admirals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.48.4,such was the corcyraean formation the corinthian was as follows on the right wing lay the megarian and ambraciot ships in the center the rest of the allies in order but the left was composed of the best sailors in the corinthian navy to encounter the athenians and the right wing of the corcyraeans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.1,as soon as the signals were raised on either side they joined battle both sides had a large number of heavy infantry on their decks and a large number of archers and darters the old imperfect armament still prevailing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.2,the seafight was an obstinate one though not remarkable for its science indeed it was more like a battle by land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.3,whenever they charged each other the multitude and crush of the vessels made it by no means easy to get loose besides their hopes of victory lay principally in the heavy infantry on the decks who stood and fought in order the ships remaining stationary the manoeuvre of breaking the line was not tried in short strength and pluck had more share in the fight than science
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.4,everywhere tumult reigned the battle being one scene of confusion meanwhile the athenian ships by coming up to the corcyraeans whenever they were pressed served to alarm the enemy though their commanders could not join in the battle from fear of their instructions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.5,the right wing of the corinthians suffered most the corcyraeans routed it and chased them in disorder to the continent with twenty ships sailed up to their camp and burnt the tents which they found empty and plundered the stuff
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.6,so in this quarter the corinthians and their allies were defeated and the corcyraeans were victorious but where the corinthians themselves were on the left they gained a decided success the scanty forces of the corcyraeans being further weakened by the want of the twenty ships absent on the pursuit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.49.7,seeing the corcyraeans hard pressed the athenians began at length to assist them more unequivocally at first it is true they refrained from charging any ships but when the rout was becoming patent and the corinthians were pressing on the time at last came when every one set to and all distinction was laid aside and it came to this point that the corinthians and athenians raised their hands against each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.50.1,after the rout the corinthians instead of employing themselves in lashing fast and hauling after them the hulls of the vessels which they had disabled turned their attention to the men whom they butchered as they sailed through not caring so much to make prisoners some even of their own friends were slain by them by mistake in their ignorance of the defeat of the right wing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.50.2,for the number of the ships on both sides and the distance to which they covered the sea made it difficult after they had once joined to distinguish between the conquering and the conquered this battle proving far greater than any before it any at least between hellenes for the number of vessels engaged
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.50.3,after the corinthians had chased the corcyraeans to the land they turned to the wrecks and their dead most of whom they succeeded in getting hold of and conveying to sybota the rendezvous of the land forces furnished by their barbarian allies sybota it must be known is a desert harbor of thesprotis this task over they mustered anew and sailed against the corcyraeans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.50.4,who on their part advanced to meet them with all their ships that were fit for service and remaining to them accompanied by the athenian vessels fearing that they might attempt a landing in their territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.50.5,it was by this time getting late and the paean had been sung for the attack when the corinthians suddenly began to back water they had observed twenty athenian ships sailing up which had been sent out afterwards to reinforce the ten vessels by the athenians who feared as it turned out justly the defeat of the corcyraeans and the inability of their handful of ships to protect them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.51.1,these ships were thus seen by the corinthians first they suspected that they were from athens and that those which they saw were not all but that there were more behind they accordingly began to retire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.51.2,the corcyraeans meanwhile had not sighted them as they were advancing from a point which they could not so well see and were wondering why the corinthians were backing water when some caught sight of them and cried out that there were ships in sight ahead upon this they also retired for it was now getting dark and the retreat of the corinthians had suspended hostilities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.51.3,thus they parted from each other and the battle ceased with night
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.51.4,the corcyraeans were in their camp at leukimme when these twenty ships from athens under the command of glaucon the son of leagrus and andocides son of leogoras bore on through the corpses and the wrecks and sailed up to the camp not long after they were sighted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.51.5,it was now night and the corcyraeans feared that they might be hostile vessels but they soon knew them and the ships came to anchor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.52.1,the next day the thirty athenian vessels put out to sea accompanied by all the corcyraean ships that were seaworthy and sailed to the harbor at sybota where the corinthians lay to see if they would engage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.52.2,the corinthians put out from the land and formed a line in the open sea but beyond this made no further movement having no intention of assuming the offensive for they saw reinforcements arrived fresh from athens and themselves confronted by numerous difficulties such as the necessity of guarding the prisoners whom they had on board and the want of all means of refitting their ships in a desert place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.52.3,what they were thinking more about was how their voyage home was to be effected they feared that the athenians might consider that the treaty was dissolved by the collision which had occurred and forbid their departure
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.53.1,accordingly they resolved to put some men on board a boat and send them without a herald s wand to the athenians as an experiment having done so they spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.53.2,you do wrong athenians to begin war and break the treaty engaged in chastising our enemies we find you placing yourselves in our path in arms against us now if your intentions are to prevent us sailing to corcyra or anywhere else that we may wish and if you are for breaking the treaty first take us that are here and treat us as enemies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.53.3,such was what they said and all the corcyraean armament that were within hearing immediately called out to take them and kill them but the athenians answered as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.53.4,neither are we beginning war peloponnesians nor are we breaking the treaty but these corcyraeans are our allies and we are come to help them so if you want to sail anywhere else we place no obstacle in your way but if you are going to sail against corcyra or any of her possessions we shall do our best to stop you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.54.1,receiving this answer from the athenians the corinthians commenced preparations for their voyage home and set up a trophy in sybota on the continent while the corcyraeans took up the wrecks and dead that had been carried out to them by the current and by a wind which rose in the night and scattered them in all directions and set up their trophy in sybota on the island as victors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.54.2,the reasons each side had for claiming the victory were these the corinthians had been victorious in the seafight until night and having thus been enabled to carry off most wrecks and dead they were in possession of no fewer than a thousand prisoners of war and had sunk close upon seventy vessels the corcyraeans had destroyed about thirty ships and after the arrival of the athenians had taken up the wrecks and dead on their side they had besides seen the corinthians retire before them backing water on sight of the athenian vessels and upon the arrival of the athenians refuse to sail out against them from sybota
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.55.1,thus both sides claimed the victory the corinthians on the voyage home took anactorium which stands at the mouth of the ambracian gulf the place was taken by treachery being common ground to the corcyraeans and corinthians after establishing corinthian settlers there they retired home eight hundred of the corcyraeans were slaves these they sold two hundred and fifty they retained in captivity and treated with great attention in the hope that they might bring over their country to corinth on their return most of them being as it happened men of very high position in corcyra
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.55.2,in this way corcyra maintained her political existence in the war with corinth and the athenian vessels left the island this was the first cause of the war that corinth had against the athenians viz that they had fought against them with the corcyraeans in time of treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.56.1,almost immediately after this fresh differences arose between the athenians and peloponnesians and contributed their share to the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.56.2,corinth was forming schemes for retaliation and athens suspected her hostility the potidaeans who inhabit the isthmus of pallene being a corinthian colony but tributary allies of athens were ordered to raze the wall looking towards pallene to give hostages to dismiss the corinthian magistrates and in future not to receive the persons sent from corinth annually to succeed them it was feared that they might be persuaded by perdiccas and the corinthians to revolt and might draw the rest of the allies in the direction of thrace to revolt with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.57.1,these precautions against the potidaeans were taken by the athenians immediately after the battle at corcyra
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.57.2,not only was corinth at length openly hostile but perdiccas son of alexander king of the macedonians had from an old friend and ally been made an enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.57.3,he had been made an enemy by the athenians entering into alliance with his brother philip and derdas who were in league against him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.57.4,in his alarm he had sent to lacedaemon to try and involve the athenians in a war with the peloponnesians and was endeavoring to win over corinth in order to bring about the revolt of potidaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.57.5,he also made overtures to the chalcidians in the direction of thrace and to the bottiaeans to persuade them to join in the revolt for he thought that if these places on the border could be made his allies it would be easier to carry on the war with their cooperation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.57.6,alive to all this and wishing to anticipate the revolt of the cities the athenians acted as follows they were just then sending off thirty ships and a thousand heavy infantry for his country under the command of archestratus son of lycomedes with four colleagues they instructed the captains to take hostages of the potidaeans to raze the wall and to be on their guard against the revolt of the neighboring cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.58.1,meanwhile the potidaeans sent envoys to athens on the chance of persuading them to take no new steps in their matters they also went to lacedaemon with the corinthians to secure support in case of need failing after prolonged negotiation to obtain anything satisfactory from the athenians being unable for all they could say to prevent the vessels that were destined for macedonia from also sailing against them and receiving from the lacedaemonian government a promise to invade attica if the athenians should attack potidaea the potidaeans thus favoured by the moment at last entered into league with the chalcidians and bottiaeans and revolted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.58.2,and perdiccas induced the chalcidians to abandon and demolish their towns on the seaboard and settling inland at olynthus to make that one city a strong place meanwhile to those who followed his advice he gave a part of his territory in mygdonia round lake bolbe as a place of abode while the war against the athenians should last they accordingly demolished their towns removed inland and prepared for war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.59.1,the thirty ships of the athenians arriving before the thracian places found potidaea and the rest in revolt
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.59.2,their commanders considering it to be quite impossible with their present force to carry on war with perdiccas and with the confederate towns as well turned to macedonia their original destination and having established themselves there carried on war in cooperation with philip and the brothers of derdas who had invaded the country from the interior
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.60.1,meanwhile the corinthians with potidaea in revolt and the athenian ships on the coast of macedonia alarmed for the safety of the place and thinking its danger theirs sent volunteers from corinth and mercenaries from the rest of peloponnese to the number of sixteen hundred heavy infantry in all and four hundred light troops
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.60.2,aristeus son of adimantus who was always a steady friend to the potidaeans took command of the expedition and it was principally for love of him that most of the men from corinth volunteered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.60.3,they arrived in thrace forty days after the revolt of potidaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.61.1,the athenians also immediately received the news of the revolt of the cities on being informed that aristeus and his reinforcements were on their way they sent two thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens and forty ships against the places in revolt under the command of callias son of calliades and four colleagues
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.61.2,they arrived in macedonia first and found the force of a thousand men that had been first sent out just become masters of therme and besieging pydna
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.61.3,accordingly they also joined in the investment and besieged pydna for a while subsequently they came to terms and concluded a forced alliance with perdiccas hastened by the calls of potidaea and by the arrival of aristeus at that place they withdrew from macedonia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.61.4,going to beroea and thence to strepsa and after a futile attempt on the latter place they pursued by land their march to potidaea with three thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens besides a number of their allies and six hundred macedonian horsemen the followers of philip and pausanias with these sailed seventy ships along the coast
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.61.5,advancing by short marches on the third day they arrived at gigonus where they encamped
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.62.1,meanwhile the potidaeans and the peloponnesians with aristeus were encamped on the side looking towards olynthus on the isthmus in expectation of the athenians and had established their market outside the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.62.2,the allies had chosen aristeus general of all the infantry while the command of the cavalry was given to perdiccas who had at once left the alliance of the athenians and gone back to that of the potidaeans having deputed iolaus as his general
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.62.3,the plan of aristeus was to keep his own force on the isthmus and await the attack of the athenians leaving the chalcidians and the allies outside the isthmus and the two hundred cavalry from perdiccas in olynthus to act upon the athenian rear on the occasion of their advancing against him and thus to place the enemy between two fires
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.62.4,while callias the athenian general and his colleagues despatched the macedonian horse and a few of the allies to olynthus to prevent any movement being made from that quarter the athenians themselves broke up their camp and marched against potidaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.62.5,after they had arrived at the isthmus and saw the enemy preparing for battle they formed against him and soon afterwards engaged
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.62.6,the wing of aristeus with the corinthians and other picked troops round him routed the wing opposed to it and followed for a considerable distance in pursuit but the rest of the army of the potidaeans and of the peloponnesians was defeated by the athenians and took refuge within the fortifications
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.63.1,returning from the pursuit aristeus perceived the defeat of the rest of the army being at a loss which of the two risks to choose whether to go to olynthus or to potidaea he at last determined to draw his men into as small a space as possible and force his way with a run into potidaea not without difficulty through a storm of missiles he passed along by the breakwater through the sea and brought off most of his men safe though a few were lost
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.63.2,meanwhile the auxiliaries of the potidaeans from olynthus which is about seven miles off and in sight of potidaea when the battle began and the signals were raised advanced a little way to render assistance and the macedonian horse formed against them to prevent it but on victory speedily declaring for the athenians and the signals being taken down they retired back within the wall and the macedonians returned to the athenians thus there were no cavalry present on either side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.63.3,after the battle the athenians set up a trophy and gave back their dead to the potidaeans under truce the potidaeans and their allies had close upon three hundred killed the athenians a hundred and fifty of their own citizens and callias their general
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.64.1,the wall on the side of the isthmus had now works at once raised against it and manned by the athenians that on the side of pallene had no works raised against it they did not think themselves strong enough at once to keep a garrison in the isthmus and to cross over to pallene and raise works there they were afraid that the potidaeans and their allies might take advantage of their division to attack them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.64.2,meanwhile the athenians at home learning that there were no works at pallene sometime afterwards sent off sixteen hundred heavy infantry of their own citizens under the command of phormio son of asopius arrived at pallene he fixed his headquarters at aphytis and led his army against potidaea by short marches ravaging the country as he advanced no one venturing to meet him in the field he raised works against the wall on the side of pallene
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.64.3,so at length potidaea was strongly invested on either side and from the sea by the ships cooperating in the blockade
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.65.1,aristeus seeing its investment complete and having no hope of its salvation except in the event of some movement from the peloponnese or of some other improbable contingency advised all except five hundred to watch for a wind and sail out of the place in order that their provisions might last the longer he was willing to be himself one of those who remained unable to persuade them and desirous of acting on the next alternative and of having things outside in the best posture possible he eluded the guardships of the athenians and sailed out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.65.2,remaining among the chalcidians he continued to carry on the war in particular he laid an ambuscade near the city of the sermylians and cut off many of them he also communicated with peloponnese and tried to contrive some method by which help might be brought meanwhile after the completion of the investment of potidaea phormio next employed his sixteen hundred men in ravaging chalcidice and bottica some of the towns also were taken by him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.66.1,the athenians and peloponnesians had these antecedent grounds of complaint against each other the complaint of corinth was that her colony of potidaea and corinthian and peloponnesian citizens within it were being besieged that of athens against the peloponnesians that they had incited a town of hers a member of her alliance and a contributor to her revenue to revolt and had come and were openly fighting against her on the side of the potidaeans for all this war had not yet broken out there was still truce for a while for this was a private enterprise on the part of corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.67.1,but the siege of potidaea put an end to her inaction she had men inside it besides she feared for the place immediately summoning the allies to lacedaemon she came and loudly accused athens of breach of the treaty and aggression on the rights of peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.67.2,with her the aeginetans formally unrepresented from fear of athens in secret proved not the least urgent of the advocates for war asserting that they had not the independence guaranteed to them by the treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.67.3,after extending the summons to any of their allies and others who might have complaints to make of athenian aggression the lacedaemonians held their ordinary assembly and invited them to speak
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.67.4,there were many who came forward and made their several accusations among them the megarians in a long list of grievances called special attention to the fact of their exclusion from the ports of the athenian empire and the market of athens in defiance of the treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.67.5,last of all the corinthians came forward and having let those who preceded them inflame the lacedaemonians now followed with a speech to this effect
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.68.1,lacedaemonians the confidence which you feel in your constitution and social order inclines you to receive any reflections of ours on other powers with a certain skepticism hence springs your moderation but hence also the rather limited knowledge which you betray in dealing with foreign politics
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.68.2,time after time was our voice raised to warn you of the blows about to be dealt us by athens and time after time instead of taking the trouble to ascertain the worth of our communications you contented yourselves with suspecting the speakers of being inspired by private interest and so instead of calling these allies together before the blow fell you have delayed to do so till we are smarting under it allies among whom we have not the worst title to speak as having the greatest complaints to make complaints of athenian outrage and lacedaemonian neglect
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.68.3,now if these assaults on the rights of hellas had been made in the dark you might be unacquainted with the facts and it would be our duty to enlighten you as it is long speeches are not needed where you see servitude accomplished for some of us meditated for others in particular for our allies and prolonged preparations in the aggressor against the hour of war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.68.4,or what pray is the meaning of their reception of corcyra by fraud and their holding it against us by force what of the siege of potidaea places one of which lies most conveniently for any action against the thracian towns while the other would have contributed a very large navy to the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.69.1,for all this you are responsible you it was who first allowed them to fortify their city after the median war and afterwards to erect the long walls you who then and now are always depriving of freedom not only those whom they have enslaved but also those who have as yet been your allies for the true author of the subjugation of a people is not so much the immediate agent as the power which permits it having the means to prevent it particularly if that power aspires to the glory of being the liberator of hellas we are at last assembled
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.69.2,it has not been easy to assemble nor even now are our objects defined we ought not to be still inquiring into the fact of our wrongs but into the means of our defence for the aggressors with matured plans to oppose to our indecision have cast threats aside and betaken themselves to action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.69.3,and we know what are the paths by which athenian aggression travels and how insidious is its progress a degree of confidence she may feel from the idea that your bluntness of perception prevents your noticing her but it is nothing to the impulse which her advance will receive from the knowledge that you see but do not care to interfere
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.69.4,you lacedaemonians of all the hellenes are alone inactive and defend yourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do something you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice its original size instead of crushing it in its infancy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.69.5,and yet the world used to say that you were to be depended upon but in your case we fear it said more than the truth the mede we ourselves know had time to come from the ends of the earth to peloponnese without any force of yours worthy of the name advancing to meet him but this was a distant enemy well athens at all events is a near neighbor and yet athens you utterly disregard against athens you prefer to act on the defensive instead of on the offensive and to make it an affair of chances by deferring the struggle till she has grown far stronger than at first and yet you know that on the whole the rock on which the barbarian was wrecked was himself and that if our present enemy athens has not again and again annihilated us we owe it more to her blunders than to your protection
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.69.6,indeed expectations from you have before now been the ruin of some whose faith induced them to omit preparation we hope that none of you will consider these words of remonstrance to be rather words of hostility men remonstrate with friends who are in error accusations they reserve for enemies who have wronged them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.1,besides we consider that we have as good a right as any one to point out a neighbor s faults particularly when we contemplate the great contrast between the two national characters a contrast of which as far as we can see you have little perception having never yet considered what sort of antagonists you will encounter in the athenians how widely how absolutely different from yourselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.2,the athenians are addicted to innovation and their designs are characterized by swiftness alike in conception and execution you have a genius for keeping what you have got accompanied by a total want of invention and when forced to act you never go far enough
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.3,again they are adventurous beyond their power and daring beyond their judgment and in danger they are sanguine your wont is to attempt less than is justified by your power to mistrust even what is sanctioned by your judgment and to fancy that from danger there is no release
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.4,further there is promptitude on their side against procrastination on yours they are never at home you are never from it for they hope by their absence to extend their acquisitions you fear by your advance to endanger what you have left behind
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.5,they are swift to follow up a success and slow to recoil from a reverse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.6,their bodies they spend ungrudgingly in their country s cause their intellect they jealously husband to be employed in her service
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.7,a scheme unexecuted is with them a positive loss a successful enterprise a comparative failure the deficiency created by the miscarriage of an undertaking is soon filled up by fresh hopes for they alone are enabled to call a thing hoped for a thing got by the speed with which they act upon their resolutions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.8,thus they toil on in trouble and danger all the days of their life with little opportunity for enjoying being ever engaged in getting their only idea of a holiday is to do what the occasion demands and to them laborious occupation is less of a misfortune than the peace of a quiet life
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.70.9,to describe their character in a word one might truly say that they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.1,such is athens your antagonist and yet lacedaemonians you still delay and fail to see that peace stays longest with those who are not more careful to use their power justly than to show their determination not to submit to injustice on the contrary your ideal of fair dealing is based on the principle that if you do not injure others you need not risk your own fortunes in preventing others from injuring you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.2,now you could scarcely have succeeded in such a policy even with a neighbor like yourselves but in the present instance as we have just shown your habits are oldfashioned as compared with theirs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.3,it is the law as in art so in politics that improvements ever prevail and though fixed usages may be best for undisturbed communities constant necessities of action must be accompanied by the constant improvement of methods thus it happens that the vast experience of athens has carried her further than you on the path of innovation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.4,here at least let your procrastination end for the present assist your allies and potidaea in particular as you promised by a speedy invasion of attica and do not sacrifice friends and kindred to their bitterest enemies and drive the rest of us in despair to some other alliance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.5,such a step would not be condemned either by the gods who received our oaths or by the men who witnessed them the breach of a treaty cannot be laid to the people whom desertion compels to seek new relations but to the power that fails to assist its confederate
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.6,but if you will only act we will stand by you it would be unnatural for us to change and never should we meet with such a congenial ally
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.71.7,for these reasons choose the right course and endeavor not to let peloponnese under your supremacy degenerate from the prestige that it enjoyed under that of your ancestors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.72.1,such were the words of the corinthians there happened to be athenian envoys present at lacedaemon on other business on hearing the speeches they thought themselves called upon to come before the lacedaemonians their intention was not to offer a defence on any of the charges which the cities brought against them but to show on a comprehensive view that it was not a matter to be hastily decided on but one that demanded further consideration there was also a wish to call attention to the great power of athens and to refresh the memory of the old and enlighten the ignorance of the young from a notion that their words might have the effect of inducing them to prefer tranquillity to war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.72.2,so they came to the lacedaemonians and said that they too if there was no objection wished to speak to their assembly they replied by inviting them to come forward the athenians advanced and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.73.1,the object of our mission here was not to argue with your allies but to attend to the matters on which our state despatched us however the vehemence of the outcry that we hear against us has prevailed on us to come forward it is not to combat the accusations of the cities indeed you are not the judges before whom either we or they can plead but to prevent your taking the wrong course on matters of great importance by yielding too readily to the persuasions of your allies we also wish to show on a review of the whole indictment that we have a fair title to our possessions and that our country has claims to consideration
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.73.2,we need not refer to remote antiquity there we could appeal to the voice of tradition but not to the experience of our audience but to the median war and contemporary history we must refer although we are rather tired of continually bringing this subject forward in our action during that war we ran great risk to obtain certain advantages you had your share in the solid results do not try to rob us of all share in the good that the glory may do us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.73.3,however the story shall be told not so much to deprecate hostility as to testify against it and to show if you are so illadvised as to enter into a struggle with athens what sort of an antagonist she is likely to prove
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.73.4,we assert that at marathon we were at the front and faced the barbarian singlehanded that when he came the second time unable to cope with him by land we went on board our ships with all our people and joined in the action at salamis this prevented his taking the peloponnesian states in detail and ravaging them with his fleet when the multitude of his vessels would have made any combination for selfdefence impossible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.73.5,the best proof of this was furnished by the invader himself defeated at sea he considered his power to be no longer what it had been and retired as speedily as possible with the greater part of his army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.74.1,such then was the result of the matter and it was clearly proved that it was on the fleet of hellas that her cause depended well to this result we contributed three very useful elements viz the largest number of ships the ablest commander and the most unhesitating patriotism our contingent of ships was little less than twothirds of the whole four hundred the commander was themistocles through whom chiefly it was that the battle took place in the straits the acknowledged salvation of our cause indeed this was the reason of your receiving him with honors such as had never been accorded to any foreign visitor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.74.2,while for daring patriotism we had no competitors receiving no reinforcements from behind seeing everything in front of us already subjugated we had the spirit after abandoning our city after sacrificing our property instead of deserting the remainder of the league or depriving them of our services by dispersing to throw ourselves into our ships and meet the danger without a thought of resenting your neglect to assist us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.74.3,we assert therefore that we conferred on you quite as much as we received for you had a stake to fight for the cities which you had left were still filled with your homes and you had the prospect of enjoying them again and your coming was prompted quite as much by fear for yourselves as for us at all events you never appeared till we had nothing left to lose but we left behind us a city that was a city no longer and staked our lives for a city that had an existence only in desperate hope and so bore our full share in your deliverance and in ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.74.4,but if we had copied others and allowed fears for our territory to make us give in our adhesion to the mede before you came or if we had suffered our ruin to break our spirit and prevent us embarking in our ships your naval inferiority would have made a seafight unnecessary and his objects would have been peaceably attained
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.75.1,surely lacedaemonians neither by the patriotism that we displayed at that crisis nor by the wisdom of our counsels do we merit our extreme unpopularity with the hellenes not at least unpopularity for our empire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.75.2,that empire we acquired by no violent means but because you were unwilling to prosecute to its conclusion the war against the barbarian and because the allies attached themselves to us and spontaneously asked us to assume the command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.75.3,and the nature of the case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height fear being our principal motive though honor and interest afterwards came in
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.75.4,and at last when almost all hated us when some had already revolted and had been subdued when you had ceased to be the friends that you once were and had become objects of suspicion and dislike it appeared no longer safe to give up our empire especially as all who left us would fall to you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.75.5,and no one can quarrel with a people for making in matters of tremendous risk the best provision that it can for its interest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.76.1,you at all events lacedaemonians have used your supremacy to settle the states in peloponnese as is agreeable to you and if at the period of which we were speaking you had persevered to the end of the matter and had incurred hatred in your command we are sure that you would have made yourselves just as galling to the allies and would have been forced to choose between a strong government and danger to yourselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.76.2,it follows that it was not a very wonderful action or contrary to the common practice of mankind if we did accept an empire that was offered to us and refused to give it up under the pressure of three of the strongest motives fear honor and interest and it was not we who set the example for it has always been the law that the weaker should be subject to the stronger besides we believed ourselves to be worthy of our position and so you thought us till now when calculations of interest have made you take up the cry of justice a consideration which no one ever yet brought forward to hinder his ambition when he had a chance of gaining anything by might
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.76.3,and praise is due to all who if not so superior to human nature as to refuse dominion yet respect justice more than their position compels them to do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.76.4,we imagine that our moderation would be best demonstrated by the conduct of others who should be placed in our position but even our equity has very unreasonably subjected us to condemnation instead of approval
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.77.1,our abatement of our rights in the contract trials with our allies and our causing them to be decided by impartial laws at athens have gained us the character of being litigious
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.77.2,and none care to inquire why this reproach is not brought against other imperial powers who treat their subjects with less moderation than we do the secret being that where force can be used law is not needed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.77.3,but our subjects are so habituated to associate with us as equals that any defeat whatever that clashes with their notions of justice whether it proceeds from a legal judgment or from the power which our empire gives us makes them forget to be grateful for being allowed to retain most of their possessions and more vexed at a part being taken than if we had from the first cast law aside and openly gratified our covetousness if we had done so not even would they have disputed that the weaker must give way to the stronger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.77.4,men s indignation it seems is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong the first looks like being cheated by an equal the second like being compelled by a superior
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.77.5,at all events they contrived to put up with much worse treatment than this from the mede yet they think our rule severe and this is to be expected for the present always weighs heavy on the conquered this at least is certain
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.77.6,if you were to succeed in overthrowing us and in taking our place you would speedily lose the popularity with which fear of us has invested you if your policy of today is at all to tally with the sample that you gave of it during the brief period of your command against the mede not only is your life at home regulated by rules and institutions incompatible with those of others but your citizens abroad act neither on these rules nor on those which are recognized by the rest of hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.78.1,take time then in forming your resolution as the matter is of great importance and do not be persuaded by the opinions and complaints of others to bring trouble on yourselves but consider the vast influence of accident in war before you are engaged in it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.78.2,as it continues it generally becomes an affair of chances chances from which neither of us is exempt and whose event we must risk in the dark
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.78.3,it is a common mistake in going to war to begin at the wrong end to act first and wait for disaster to discuss the matter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.78.4,but we are not yet by any means so misguided nor so far as we can see are you accordingly while it is still open to us both to choose aright we bid you not to dissolve the treaty or to break your oaths but to have our differences settled by arbitration according to our agreement or else we take the gods who heard the oaths to witness and if you begin hostilities whatever line of action you choose we will try not to be behindhand in repelling you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.79.1,such were the words of the athenians after the lacedaemonians had heard the complaints of the allies against the athenians and the observations of the latter they made all withdraw and consulted by themselves on the question before them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.79.2,the opinions of the majority all led to the same conclusion the athenians were open aggressors and war must be declared at once but archidamus the lacedaemonian king came forward who had the reputation of being at once a wise and a moderate man and made the following speech
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.80.1,i have not lived so long lacedaemonians without having had the experience of many wars and i see those among you of the same age as myself who will not fall into the common misfortune of longing for war from inexperience or from a belief in its advantage and its safety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.80.2,this the war on which you are now debating would be one of the greatest magnitude on a sober consideration of the matter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.80.3,in a struggle with peloponnesians and neighbors our strength is of the same character and it is possible to move swiftly on the different points but a struggle with a people who live in a distant land who have also an extraordinary familiarity with the sea and who are in the highest state of preparation in every other department with wealth private and public with ships and horses and heavy infantry and a population such as no one other hellenic place can equal and lastly a number of tributary allies what can justify us in rashly beginning such a struggle wherein is our trust that we should rush on it unprepared
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.80.4,is it in our ships there we are inferior while if we are to practise and become a match for them time must intervene is it in our money there we have a far greater deficiency we neither have it in our treasury nor are we ready to contribute it from our private funds
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.81.1,confidence might possibly be felt in our superiority in heavy infantry and population which will enable us to invade and devastate their lands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.81.2,but the athenians have plenty of other land in their empire and can import what they want by sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.81.3,again if we are to attempt an insurrection of their allies these will have to be supported with a fleet most of them being islanders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.81.4,what then is to be our war for unless we can either beat them at sea or deprive them of the revenues which feed their navy we shall meet with little but disaster
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.81.5,meanwhile our honor will be pledged to keeping on particularly if it be the opinion that we began the quarrel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.81.6,for let us never be elated by the fatal hope of the war being quickly ended by the devastation of their lands i fear rather that we may leave it as a legacy to our children so improbable is it that the athenian spirit will be the slave of their land or athenian experience be cowed by war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.82.1,not that i would bid you be so unfeeling as to suffer them to injure your allies and to refrain from unmasking their intrigues but i do bid you not to take up arms at once but to send and remonstrate with them in a tone not too suggestive of war nor again too suggestive of submission and to employ the interval in perfecting our own preparations the means will be first the acquisition of allies hellenic or barbarian it matters not so long as they are an accession to our strength naval or pecuniary i say hellenic or barbarian because the odium of such an accession to all who like us are the objects of the designs of the athenians is taken away by the law of selfpreservation and secondly the development of our home resources
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.82.2,if they listen to our embassy so much the better but if not after the lapse of two or three years our position will have become materially strengthened and we can then attack them if we think proper
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.82.3,perhaps by that time the sight of our preparations backed by language equally significant will have disposed them to submission while their land is still untouched and while their counsels may be directed to the retention of advantages as yet undestroyed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.82.4,for the only light in which you can view their land is that of a hostage in your hands a hostage the more valuable the better it is cultivated this you ought to spare as long as possible and not make them desperate and so increase the difficulty of dealing with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.82.5,for if while still unprepared hurried away by the complaints of our allies we are induced to lay it waste have a care that we do not bring deep disgrace and deep perplexity upon peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.82.6,complaints whether of communities or individuals it is possible to adjust but war undertaken by a coalition for sectional interests whose progress there is no means of foreseeing does not easily admit of creditable settlement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.83.1,and none need think it cowardice for a number of confederates to pause before they attack a single city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.83.2,the athenians have allies as numerous as our own and allies that pay tribute and war is a matter not so much of arms as of money which makes arms of use and this is more than ever true in a struggle between a continental and a maritime power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.83.3,first then let us provide money and not allow ourselves to be carried away by the talk of our allies before we have done so as we shall have the largest share of responsibility for the consequences be they good or bad we have also a right to a tranquil inquiry respecting them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.84.1,and the slowness and procrastination the parts of our character that are most assailed by their criticism need not make you blush if we undertake the war without preparation we should by hastening its commencement only delay its conclusion further a free and a famous city has through all time been ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.84.2,the quality which they condemn is really nothing but a wise moderation thanks to its possession we alone do not become insolent in success and give way less than others in misfortune we are not carried away by the pleasure of hearing ourselves cheered on to risks which our judgment condemns nor if annoyed are we any the more convinced by attempts to exasperate us by accusation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.84.3,we are both warlike and wise and it is our sense of order that makes us so we are warlike because selfcontrol contains honor as a chief constituent and honor bravery and we are wise because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws and with too severe a selfcontrol to disobey them and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters such as the knowledge which can give a specious criticism of an enemy s plans in theory but fails to assail them with equal success in practice but are taught to consider that the schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own and that the freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.84.4,in practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good indeed it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders but on the soundness of our provisions nor ought we to believe that there is much difference between man and man but to think that the superiority lies with him who is reared in the severest school
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.85.1,these practices then which our ancestors have delivered to us and by whose maintenance we have always profited must not be given up and we must not be hurried into deciding in a day s brief space a question which concerns many lives and fortunes and many cities and in which honor is deeply involved but we must decide calmly this our strength peculiarly enables us to do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.85.2,as for the athenians send to them on the matter of potidaea send on the matter of the alleged wrongs of the allies particularly as they are prepared with legal satisfaction and to proceed against one who offers arbitration as against a wrongdoer law forbids meanwhile do not omit preparation for war this decision will be the best for yourselves the most terrible to your opponents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.85.3,such were the words of archidamus last came forward sthenelaidas one of the ephors for that year and spoke to the lacedaemonians as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.86.1,the long speech of the athenians i do not pretend to understand they said a good deal in praise of themselves but nowhere denied that they are injuring our allies and peloponnese and yet if they behaved well against the mede then but ill towards us now they deserve double punishment for having ceased to be good and for having become bad
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.86.2,we meanwhile are the same then and now and shall not if we are wise disregard the wrongs of our allies or put off till tomorrow the duty of assisting those who must suffer today
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.86.3,others have much money and ships and horses but we have good allies whom we must not give up to the athenians nor by lawsuits and words decide the matter as it is anything but in word that we are harmed but render instant and powerful help
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.86.4,and let us not be told that it is fitting for us to deliberate under injustice long deliberation is rather fitting for those who have injustice in contemplation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.86.5,vote therefore lacedaemonians for war as the honor of sparta demands and neither allow the further aggrandizement of athens nor betray our allies to ruin but with the gods let us advance against the aggressors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.87.1,with these words he as ephor himself put the question to the assembly of the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.87.2,he said that he could not determine which was the loudest acclamation their mode of decision is by acclamation not by voting the fact being that he wished to make them declare their opinion openly and thus to increase their ardor for war accordingly he said all lacedaemonians who are of opinion that the treaty has been broken and that athens is guilty leave your seats and go there pointing out a certain place all who are of the opposite opinion there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.87.3,they accordingly stood up and divided and those who held that the treaty had been broken were in a decided majority
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.87.4,summoning the allies they told them that their opinion was that athens had been guilty of injustice but that they wished to convoke all the allies and put it to the vote in order that they might make war if they decided to do so on a common resolution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.87.5,having thus gained their point the delegates returned home at once the athenian envoys a little later when they had despatched the objects of their mission
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.87.6,this decision of the assembly judging that the treaty had been broken was made in the fourteenth year of the thirty years truce which was entered into after the affair of euboea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.88.1,the lacedaemonians voted that the treaty had been broken and that war must be declared not so much because they were persuaded by the arguments of the allies as because they feared the growth of the power of the athenians seeing most of hellas already subject to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.89.1,the way in which athens came to be placed in the circumstances under which her power grew was this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.89.2,after the medes had returned from europe defeated by sea and land by the hellenes and after those of them who had fled with their ships to mycale had been destroyed leotychides king of the lacedaemonians the commander of the hellenes at mycale departed home with the allies from peloponnese but the athenians and the allies from ionia and hellespont who had now revolted from the king remained and laid siege to sestos which was still held by the medes after wintering before it they became masters of the place on its evacuation by the barbarians and after this they sailed away from hellespont to their respective cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.89.3,meanwhile the athenian people after the departure of the barbarian from their country at once proceeded to carry over their children and wives and such property as they had left from the places where they had deposited them and prepared to rebuild their city and their walls for only isolated portions of the circumference had been left standing and most of the houses were in ruins though a few remained in which the persian grandees had taken up their quarters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.90.1,perceiving what they were going to do the lacedaemonians sent an embassy to athens they would have themselves preferred to see neither her nor any other city in possession of a wall though here they acted principally at the instigation of their allies who were alarmed at the strength of her newly acquired navy and the valor which she had displayed in the war with the medes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.90.2,they begged her not only to abstain from building walls for herself but also to join them in throwing down the walls that still held together of the ultrapeloponnesian cities the real meaning of their advice the suspicion that it contained against the athenians was not proclaimed it was urged that so the barbarian in the event of a third invasion would not have any strong place such as he now had in thebes for his base of operations and that peloponnese would suffice for all as a base both for retreat and offence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.90.3,after the lacedaemonians had thus spoken they were on the advice of themistocles immediately dismissed by the athenians with the answer that ambassadors should be sent to sparta to discuss the question themistocles told the athenians to send him off with all speed to lacedaemon but not to despatch his colleagues as soon as they had selected them but to wait until they had raised their wall to the height from which defence was possible meanwhile the whole population in the city was to labour at the wall the athenians their wives and their children sparing no edifice private or public which might be of any use to the work but throwing all down
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.90.4,after giving these instructions and adding that he would be responsible for all other matters there he departed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.90.5,arrived at lacedaemon he did not seek an audience with the authorities but tried to gain time and made excuses when any of the government asked him why he did not appear in the assembly he would say that he was waiting for his colleagues who had been detained in athens by some engagement however that he expected their speedy arrival and wondered that they were not yet there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.1,at first the lacedaemonians trusted the words of themistocles through their friendship for him but when others arrived all distinctly declaring that the work was going on and already attaining some elevation they did not know how to disbelieve it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.2,aware of this he told them that rumors are deceptive and should not be trusted they should send some reputable persons from sparta to inspect whose report might be trusted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.3,they despatched them accordingly concerning these themistocles secretly sent word to the athenians to detain them as far as possible without putting them under open constraint and not to let them go until they had themselves returned for his colleagues had now joined him abronichus son of lysicles and aristides son of lysimachus with the news that the wall was sufficiently advanced and he feared that when the lacedaemonians heard the facts they might refuse to let them go
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.4,so the athenians detained the envoys according to his message and themistocles had an audience with the lacedaemonians and at last openly told them that athens was now fortified sufficiently to protect its inhabitants that any embassy which the lacedaemonians or their allies might wish to send to them should in future proceed on the assumption that the people to whom they were going was able to distinguish both its own and the general interests
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.5,that when the athenians thought fit to abandon their city and to embark in their ships they ventured on that perilous step without consulting them and that on the other hand wherever they had deliberated with the lacedaemonians they had proved themselves to be in judgment second to none
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.6,that they now thought it fit that their city should have a wall and that this would be more for the advantage of both the citizens of athens and the hellenic confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.91.7,for without equal military strength it was impossible to contribute equal or fair counsel to the common interest it followed he observed either that all the members of the confederacy should be without walls or that the present step should be considered a right one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.92.1,the lacedaemonians did not betray any open signs of anger against the athenians at what they heard the embassy it seems was prompted not by a desire to obstruct but to guide the counsels of their government besides spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards athens on account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle with the mede still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause them secret annoyance the envoys of each state departed home without complaint
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.1,in this way the athenians walled their city in a little while
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.2,to this day the building shows signs of the haste of its execution the foundations are laid of stones of all kinds and in some places not wrought or fitted but placed just in the order in which they were brought by the different hands and many columns too from tombs and sculptured stones were put in with the rest for the bounds of the city were extended at every point of the circumference and so they laid hands on everything without exception in their haste
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.3,themistocles also persuaded them to finish the walls of piraeus which had been begun before in his year of office as archon being influenced alike by the fineness of a locality that has three natural harbors and by the great start which the athenians would gain in the acquisition of power by becoming a naval people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.4,for he first ventured to tell them to stick to the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.5,it was by his advice too that they built the walls of that thickness which can still be discerned round piraeus the stones being brought up by two wagons meeting each other between the walls thus formed there was neither rubble nor mortar but great stones hewn square and fitted together cramped to each other on the outside with iron and lead about half the height that he intended was finished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.6,his idea was by their size and thickness to keep off the attacks of an enemy he thought that they might be adequately defended by a small garrison of invalids and the rest be freed for service in the fleet
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.7,for the fleet claimed most of his attention he saw as i think that the approach by sea was easier for the king s army than that by land he also thought piraeus more valuable than the upper city indeed he was always advising the athenians if a day should come when they were hard pressed by land to go down into piraeus and defy the world with their fleet
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.93.8,thus therefore the athenians completed their wall and commenced their other buildings immediately after the retreat of the mede
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.94.1,meanwhile pausanias son of cleombrotus was sent out from lacedaemon as commanderinchief of the hellenes with twenty ships from peloponnese with him sailed the athenians with thirty ships and a number of the other allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.94.2,they made an expedition against cyprus and subdued most of the island and afterwards against byzantium which was in the hands of the medes and compelled it to surrender this event took place while the spartans were still supreme
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.1,but the violence of pausanias had already begun to be disagreeable to the hellenes particularly to the ionians and the newly liberated populations these resorted to the athenians and requested them as their kinsmen to become their leaders and to stop any attempt at violence on the part of pausanias
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.2,the athenians accepted their overtures and determined to put down any attempt of the kind and to settle everything else as their interests might seem to demand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.3,in the meantime the lacedaemonians recalled pausanias for an investigation of the reports which had reached them manifold and grave accusations had been brought against him by hellenes arriving in sparta and to all appearance there had been in him more of the mimicry of a despot than of the attitude of a general
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.4,as it happened his recall came just at the time when the hatred which he had inspired had induced the allies to desert him the soldiers from peloponnese excepted and to range themselves by the side of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.5,on his arrival at lacedaemon he was censured for his private acts of oppression but was acquitted on the heaviest counts and pronounced not guilty it must be known that the charge of medism formed one of the principal and to all appearance one of the bestfounded articles against him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.6,the lacedaemonians did not however restore him to his command but sent out dorkis and certain others with a small force who found the allies no longer inclined to concede to them the supremacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.95.7,perceiving this they departed and the lacedaemonians did not send out any to succeed them they feared for those who went out a deterioration similar to that observable in pausanias besides they desired to be rid of the median war and were satisfied of the competency of the athenians for the position and of their friendship at the time towards themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.96.1,the athenians having thus succeeded to the supremacy by the voluntary act of the allies through their hatred of pausanias fixed which cities were to contribute money against the barbarian which ships their professed object being to retaliate for their sufferings by ravaging the king s country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.96.2,now was the time that the office of treasurers for hellas was first instituted by the athenians these officers received the tribute as the money contributed was called the tribute was first fixed at four hundred and sixty talents the common treasury was at delos and the congresses were held in the temple
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.97.1,their supremacy commenced with independent allies who acted on the resolutions of a common congress it was marked by the following undertakings in war and in administration during the interval between the median and the present war against the barbarian against their own rebel allies and against the peloponnesian powers which would come in contact with them on various occasions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.97.2,my excuse for relating these events and for venturing on this digression is that this passage of history has been omitted by all my predecessors who have confined themselves either to hellenic history before the median war or to the median war itself hellanicus it is true did touch on these events in his athenian history but he is somewhat concise and not accurate in his dates besides the history of these events contains an explanation of the growth of the athenian empire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.98.1,first the athenians besieged and captured eion on the strymon from the medes and made slaves of the inhabitants being under the command of cimon son of miltiades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.98.2,next they enslaved scyros the island in the aegean containing a dolopian population and colonized it themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.98.3,this was followed by a war against carystus in which the rest of euboea remained neutral and which was ended by surrender on conditions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.98.4,after this naxos left the confederacy and a war ensued and she had to return after a siege this was the first instance of the engagement being broken by the subjugation of an allied city a precedent which was followed by that of the rest in the order which circumstances prescribed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.99.1,of all the causes of defection that connected with arrears of tribute and vessels and with failure of service was the chief for the athenians were very severe and exacting and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any continuous labour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.99.2,in some other respects the athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been at first and if they had more than their fair share of service it was correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.99.3,for this the allies had themselves to blame the wish to get off service making most of them arrange to pay their share of the expense in money instead of in ships and so to avoid having to leave their homes thus while athens was increasing her navy with the funds which they contributed a revolt always found them without resources or experience for war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.100.1,next we come to the actions by land and by sea at the river eurymedon in pamphylia between the athenians with their allies and the medes when the athenians won both battles on the same day under the conduct of cimon son of miltiades and captured and destroyed the whole phoenician fleet consisting of two hundred vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.100.2,some time afterwards occurred the defection of the thasians caused by disagreements about the marts on the opposite coast of thrace and about the mine in their possession sailing with a fleet to thasos the athenians defeated them at sea and effected a landing on the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.100.3,about the same time they sent ten thousand settlers of their own citizens and the allies to settle the place then called ennea hodoi or nine ways now amphipolis they succeeded in gaining possession of ennea hodoi from the edonians but on advancing into the interior of thrace were cut off in drabescus a town of the edonians by the assembled thracians who regarded the settlement of the place ennea hodoi as an act of hostility
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.101.1,meanwhile the thasians being defeated in the field and suffering siege appealed to lacedaemon and desired her to assist them by an invasion of attica
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.101.2,without informing athens she promised and intended to do so but was prevented by the occurrence of the earthquake accompanied by the secession of the helots and the thuriats and aethaeans of the perioeci to ithome most of the helots were the descendants of the old messenians that were enslaved in the famous war and so all of them came to be called messenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.101.3,so the lacedaemonians being engaged in a war with the rebels in ithome the thasians in the third year of the siege obtained terms from the athenians by razing their walls delivering up their ships and arranging to pay the monies demanded at once and tribute in future giving up their possessions on the continent together with the mine
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.102.1,the lacedaemonians meanwhile finding the war against the rebels in ithome likely to last invoked the aid of their allies and especially of the athenians who came in some force under the command of cimon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.102.2,the reason for this pressing summons lay in their reputed skill in siege operations a long siege had taught the lacedaemonians their own deficiency in this art else they would have taken the place by assault
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.102.3,the first open quarrel between the lacedaemonians and athenians arose out of this expedition the lacedaemonians when assault failed to take the place apprehensive of the enterprising and revolutionary character of the athenians and further looking upon them as of alien extraction began to fear that if they remained they might be tempted by the besieged in ithome to attempt some political changes they accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies without declaring their suspicions but merely saying that they had now no need of them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.102.4,but the athenians aware that their dismissal did not proceed from the more honorable reason of the two but from suspicions which had been conceived went away deeply offended and conscious of having done nothing to merit such treatment from the lacedaemonians and the instant that they returned home they broke off the alliance which had been made against the mede and allied themselves with sparta s enemy argos each of the contracting parties taking the same oaths and making the same alliance with the thessalians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.103.1,meanwhile the rebels in ithome unable to prolong further a ten years resistance surrendered to lacedaemon the conditions being that they should depart from peloponnese under safe conduct and should never set foot in it again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.103.2,any one who might hereafter be found there was to be the slave of his captor it must be known that the lacedaemonians had an old oracle from delphi to the effect that they should let go the suppliant of zeus at ithome
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.103.3,so they went forth with their children and their wives and being received by athens from the hatred that she now felt for the lacedaemonians were located at naupactus which she had lately taken from the ozolian locrians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.103.4,the athenians received another addition to their confederacy in the megarians who left the lacedaemonian alliance annoyed by a war about boundaries forced on them by corinth the athenians occupied megara and pegae and built the megarians their long walls from the city to nisaea in which they placed an athenian garrison this was the principal cause of the corinthians conceiving such a deadly hatred against athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.104.1,meanwhile inaros son of psammetichus a libyan king of the libyans on the egyptian border having his headquarters at marea the town above pharos caused a revolt of almost the whole of egypt from king artaxerxes and placing himself at its head invited the athenians to his assistance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.104.2,abandoning a cyprian expedition upon which they happened to be engaged with two hundred ships of their own and their allies they arrived in egypt and sailed from the sea into the nile and making themselves masters of the river and twothirds of memphis addressed themselves to the attack of the remaining third which is called white castle within it were persians and medes who had taken refuge there and egyptians who had not joined the rebellion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.105.1,meanwhile the athenians making a descent from their fleet upon haliae were engaged by a force of corinthians and epidaurians and the corinthians were victorious afterwards the athenians engaged the peloponnesian fleet off cecruphalia and the athenians were victorious
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.105.2,subsequently war broke out between aegina and athens and there was a great battle at sea off aegina between the athenians and aeginetans each being aided by their allies in which victory remained with the athenians who took seventy of the enemy s ships and landed in the country and commenced a siege under the command of leocrates son of stroebus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.105.3,upon this the peloponnesians desirous of aiding the aeginetans threw into aegina a force of three hundred heavy infantry who had before been serving with the corinthians and epidaurians meanwhile the corinthians and their allies occupied the heights of geraneia and marched down into the megarid in the belief that with a large force absent in aegina and egypt athens would be unable to help the megarians without raising the siege of aegina
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.105.4,but the athenians instead of moving the army of aegina raised a force of the old and young men that had been left in the city and marched into the megarid under the command of myronides
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.105.5,after a drawn battle with the corinthians the rival hosts parted each with the impression that they had gained the victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.105.6,the athenians however if anything had rather the advantage and on the departure of the corinthians set up a trophy urged by the taunts of the elders in their city the corinthians made their preparations and about twelve days afterwards came and set up their trophy as victors sallying out from megara the athenians cut off the party that was employed in erecting the trophy and engaged and defeated the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.106.1,in the retreat of the vanquished army a considerable division pressed by the pursuers and mistaking the road dashed into a field on some private property with a deep trench all round it and no way out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.106.2,being acquainted with the place the athenians hemmed their front with heavy infantry and placing the light troops round in a circle stoned all who had gone in corinth here suffered a severe blow the bulk of her army continued its retreat home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.107.1,about this time the athenians began to build the long walls to the sea that towards phalerum and that towards piraeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.107.2,meanwhile the phocians made an expedition against doris the old home of the lacedaemonians containing the towns of boeum kitinium and erineum they had taken one of these towns when the lacedaemonians under nicomedes son of cleombrotus commanding for king pleistoanax son of pausanias who was still a minor came to the aid of the dorians with fifteen hundred heavy infantry of their own and ten thousand of their allies after compelling the phocians to restore the town on conditions they began their retreat
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.107.3,the route by sea across the crissaean gulf exposed them to the risk of being stopped by the athenian fleet that across geraneia seemed scarcely safe the athenians holding megara and pegae for the pass was a difficult one and was always guarded by the athenians and in the present instance the lacedaemonians had information that they meant to dispute their passage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.107.4,so they resolved to remain in boeotia and to consider which would be the safest line of march they had also another reason for this resolve secret encouragement had been given them by a party in athens who hoped to put an end to the reign of democracy and the building of the long walls
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.107.5,meanwhile the athenians marched against them with their whole levy and a thousand argives and the respective contingents of the rest of their allies altogether they were fourteen thousand strong

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.107.7,some cavalry also joined the athenians from their thessalian allies but these went over to the lacedaemonians during the battle

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.109.2,first the athenians were masters of egypt and the king sent megabyzus a persian to lacedaemon with money to bribe the peloponnesians to invade attica and so draw off the athenians from egypt
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.109.3,finding that the matter made no progress and that the money was only being wasted he recalled megabazus with the remainder of the money and sent megabuzus son of zopyrus a persian with a large army to egypt

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.110.1,thus the enterprise of the hellenes came to ruin after six years of war of all that large host a few travelling through libya reached cyrene in safety but most of them perished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.110.2,and thus egypt returned to its subjection to the king except amyrtaeus the king in the marshes whom they were unable to capture from the extent of the marsh the marshmen being also the most warlike of the egyptians

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.112.5,after this the lacedaemonians marched out on a sacred war and becoming masters of the temple at delphi placed it in the hands of the delphians immediately after their retreat the athenians marched out became masters of the temple and placed it in the hands of the phocians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.113.1,some time after this orchomenus chaeronea and some other places in boeotia being in the hands of the boeotian exiles the athenians marched against the abovementioned hostile places with a thousand athenian heavy infantry and the allied contingents under the command of tolmides son of tolmaeus they took chaeronea and made slaves of the inhabitants and leaving a garrison commenced their return
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.113.2,on their road they were attacked at coronaea by the boeotian exiles from orchomenus with some locrians and euboean exiles and others who were of the same way of thinking were defeated in battle and some killed others taken captive

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.114.1,this was soon afterwards followed by the revolt of euboea from athens pericles had already crossed over with an army of athenians to the island when news was brought to him that megara had revolted that the peloponnesians were on the point of invading attica and that the athenian garrison had been cut off by the megarians with the exception of a few who had taken refuge in nisaea the megarians had introduced the corinthians sicyonians and epidaurians into the town before they revolted meanwhile pericles brought his army back in all haste from euboea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.114.2,after this the peloponnesians marched into attica as far as eleusis and thrius ravaging the country under the conduct of king pleistoanax the son of pausanias and without advancing further returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.114.3,the athenians then crossed over again to euboea under the command of pericles and subdued the whole of the island all but histiaea was settled by convention the histiaeans they expelled from their homes and occupied their territory themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.115.1,not long after their return from euboea they made a truce with the lacedaemonians and their allies for thirty years giving up the posts which they occupied in peloponnese nisaea pegae troezen and achaia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.115.2,in the sixth year of the truce war broke out between the samians and milesians about priene worsted in the war the milesians came to athens with loud complaints against the samians in this they were joined by certain private persons from samos itself who wished to revolutionize the government
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.115.3,accordingly the athenians sailed to samos with forty ships and set up a democracy took hostages from the samians fifty boys and as many men lodged them in lemnos and after leaving a garrison in the island returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.115.4,but some of the samians had not remained in the island but had fled to the continent making an agreement with the most powerful of those in the city and an alliance with pissuthnes son of hystaspes the then satrap of sardis they got together a force of seven hundred mercenaries and under cover of night crossed over to samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.115.5,their first step was to rise on the commons most of whom they secured their next to steal their hostages from lemnos after which they revolted gave up the athenian garrison left with them and its commanders to pissuthnes and instantly prepared for an expedition against miletus the byzantines also revolted with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.116.1,as soon as the athenians heard the news they sailed with sixty ships against samos sixteen of these went to caria to look out for the phoenician fleet and to chios and lesbos carrying round orders for reinforcements and so never engaged but fortyfour ships under the command of pericles with nine colleagues gave battle off the island of tragia to seventy samian vessels of which twenty were transports as they were sailing from miletus victory remained with the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.116.2,reinforced afterwards by forty ships from athens and twentyfive chian and lesbian vessels the athenians landed and having the superiority by land invested the city with three walls it was also invested from the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.116.3,meanwhile pericles took sixty ships from the blockading squadron and departed in haste for caunus and caria intelligence having been brought in of the approach of the phoenician fleet to the aid of the samians indeed stesagoras and others had left the island with five ships to bring them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.117.1,but in the meantime the samians made a sudden sally and fell on the camp which they found unfortified destroying the lookout vessels and engaging and defeating such as were being launched to meet them they remained masters of their own seas for fourteen days and carried in and carried out what they pleased
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.117.2,but on the arrival of pericles they were once more shut up fresh reinforcements afterwards arrived forty ships from athens with thucydides hagnon and phormio twenty with tlepolemus and anticles and thirty vessels from chios and lesbos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.117.3,after a brief attempt at fighting the samians unable to hold out were reduced after a nine months siege and surrendered on conditions they razed their walls gave hostages delivered up their ships and arranged to pay the expenses of the war by instalments the byzantines also agreed to be subject as before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.118.1,after this though not many years later we at length come to what has been already related the affairs of corcyra and potidaea and the events that served as a pretext for the present war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.118.2,all these actions of the hellenes against each other and the barbarian occurred in the fifty years interval between the retreat of xerxes and the beginning of the present war during this interval the athenians succeeded in placing their empire on a firmer basis and advanced their own home power to a very great height the lacedaemonians though fully aware of it opposed it only for a little while but remained inactive during most of the period being of old slow to go to war except under the pressure of necessity and in the present instance being hampered by wars at home until the growth of the athenian power could be no longer ignored and their own confederacy became the object of its encroachments they then felt that they could endure it no longer but that the time had come for them to throw themselves heart and soul upon the hostile power and break it if they could by commencing the present war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.118.3,and though the lacedaemonians had made up their own minds on the fact of the breach of the treaty and the guilt of the athenians yet they sent to delphi and inquired of the god whether it would be well with them if they went to war and as it is reported received from him the answer that if they put their whole strength into the war victory would be theirs and the promise that he himself would be with them whether invoked or uninvoked
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.119.1,still they wished to summon their allies again and to take their vote on the propriety of making war after the ambassadors from the confederates had arrived and a congress had been convened they all spoke their minds most of them denouncing the athenians and demanding that the war should begin in particular the corinthians they had before on their own account canvassed the cities in detail to induce them to vote for the war in the fear that it might come too late to save potidaea they were present also on this occasion and came forward the last and made the following speech
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.120.1,fellow allies we can no longer accuse the lacedaemonians of having failed in their duty they have not only voted for war themselves but have assembled us here for that purpose we say their duty for supremacy has its duties besides equitably administering private interests leaders are required to show a special care for the common welfare in return for the special honors accorded to them by all in other ways
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.120.2,for ourselves all who have already had dealings with the athenians require no warning to be on their guard against them the states more inland and out of the highway of communication should understand that if they omit to support the coast powers the result will be to injure the transit of their produce for exportation and the reception in exchange of their imports from the sea and they must not be careless judges of what is now said as if it had nothing to do with them but must expect that the sacrifice of the powers on the coast will one day be followed by the extension of the danger to the interior and must recognize that their own interests are deeply involved in this discussion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.120.3,for these reasons they should not hesitate to exchange peace for war if wise men remain quiet while they are not injured brave men abandon peace for war when they are injured returning to an understanding on a favorable opportunity in fact they are neither intoxicated by their success in war nor disposed to take an injury for the sake of the delightful tranquillity of peace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.120.4,indeed to falter for the sake of such delights is if you remain inactive the quickest way of losing the sweets of repose to which you cling while to conceive extravagant pretensions from success in war is to forget how hollow is the confidence by which you are elated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.120.5,for if many illconceived plans have succeeded through the still greater fatuity of an opponent many more apparently well laid have on the contrary ended in disgrace the confidence with which we form our schemes is never completely justified in their execution speculation is carried on in safety but when it comes to action fear causes failure
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.121.1,to apply these rules to ourselves if we are now kindling war it is under the pressure of injury and with adequate grounds of complaint and after we have chastised the athenians we will in season desist
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.121.2,we have many reasons to expect success first superiority in numbers and in military experience and secondly our general and unvarying obedience in the execution of orders the naval strength
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.121.3,which they possess shall be raised by us from our respective antecedent resources and from the monies at olympia and delphi a loan from these enables us to seduce their foreign sailors by the offer of higher pay for the power of athens is more mercenary than national while ours will not be exposed to the same risk as its strength lies more in men than in money
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.121.4,a single defeat at sea is in all likelihood their ruin should they hold out in that case there will be the more time for us to exercise ourselves in naval matters and as soon as we have arrived at an equality in science we need scarcely ask whether we shall be their superiors in courage for the advantages that we have by nature they cannot acquire by education while their superiority in science must be removed by our practice
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.121.5,the money required for these objects shall be provided by our contributions nothing indeed could be more monstrous than the suggestion that while their allies never tire of contributing for their own servitude we should refuse to spend for vengeance and selfpreservation the treasure which by such refusal we shall forfeit to athenian rapacity and see employed for our own ruin
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.122.1,we have also other ways of carrying on the war such as revolt of their allies the surest method of depriving them of their revenues which are the source of their strength and establishment of fortified positions in their country and various operations which cannot be foreseen at present for war of all things proceeds least upon definite rules but draws principally upon itself for contrivances to meet an emergency and in such cases the party who faces the struggle and keeps his temper best meets with most security and he who loses his temper about it with correspondent disaster
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.122.2,let us also reflect that if it was merely a number of disputes of territory between rival neighbors it might be borne but here we have an enemy in athens that is a match for our whole coalition and more than a match for any of its members so that unless as a body and as individual nationalities and individual cities we make an unanimous stand against her she will easily conquer us divided and in detail that conquest terrible as it may sound would it must be known have no other end than slavery pure and simple
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.122.3,a word which peloponnese cannot even hear whispered without disgrace or without disgrace see so many states abused by one meanwhile the opinion would be either that we were justly so used or that we put up with it from cowardice and were proving degenerate sons in not even securing for ourselves the freedom which our fathers gave to hellas and in allowing the establishment in hellas of a tyrant state though in individual states we think it our duty to put down sole rulers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.122.4,and we do not know how this conduct can be held free from three of the gravest failings want of sense of courage or of vigilance for we do not suppose that you have taken refuge in that contempt of an enemy which has proved so fatal in so many instances a feeling which from the numbers that it has ruined has come to be called not contemptuous but contemptible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.123.1,there is however no advantage in reflections on the past further than may be of service to the present for the future we must provide by maintaining what the present gives us and redoubling our efforts it is hereditary to us to win virtue as the fruit of labour and you must not change the habit even though you should have a slight advantage in wealth and resources for it is not right that what was won in want should be lost in plenty no we must boldly advance to the war for many reasons the god has commanded it and promised to be with us and the rest of hellas will all join in the struggle part from fear part from interest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.123.2,you will not be the first to break a treaty which the god in advising us to go to war judges to be violated already but rather to support a treaty that has been outraged indeed treaties are broken not by resistance but by aggression
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.124.1,your position therefore from whatever quarter you may view it will amply justify you in going to war and this step we recommend in the interests of all bearing in mind that identity of interests is the surest of bonds whether between states or individuals delay not therefore to assist potidaea a dorian city besieged by ionians which is quite a reversal of the order of things nor to assert the freedom of the rest it is impossible for us to wait any longer when waiting can only mean immediate disaster for some of us and if it comes to be known that we have conferred but do not venture to protect ourselves like disaster in the near future for the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.124.2,delay not fellow allies but convinced of the necessity of the crisis and the wisdom of this counsel vote for the war undeterred by its immediate terrors but looking beyond to the lasting peace by which it will be succeeded out of war peace gains fresh stability but to refuse to abandon repose for war is not so sure a method of avoiding danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.124.3,we must believe that the tyrant city that has been established in hellas has been established against all alike with a programme of universal empire part fulfilled part in contemplation let us then attack and reduce it and win future security for ourselves and freedom for the hellenes who are now enslaved such were the words of the corinthians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.125.1,the lacedaemonians having now heard all give their opinion took the vote of all the allied states present in order great and small alike and the majority voted for war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.125.2,this decided it was still impossible for them to commence at once from their want of preparation but it was resolved that the means requisite were to be procured by the different states and that there was to be no delay and indeed in spite of the time occupied with the necessary arrangements less than a year elapsed before attica was invaded and the war openly begun
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.1,this interval was spent in sending embassies to athens charged with complaints in order to obtain as good a pretext for war as possible in the event of her paying no attention to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.2,the first lacedaemonian embassy was to order the athenians to drive out the curse of the goddess the history of which is as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.3,in former generations there was an athenian of the name of cylon a victor at the olympic games of good birth and powerful position who had married a daughter of theagenes a megarian at that time tyrant of megara
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.4,now this cylon was inquiring at delphi when he was told by the god to seize the acropolis of athens on the grand festival of zeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.5,accordingly procuring a force from theagenes and persuading his friends to join him when the olympic festival in peloponnese came he seized the acropolis with the intention of making himself tyrant thinking that this was the grand festival of zeus and also an occasion appropriate for a victor at the olympic games
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.6,whether the grand festival that was meant was in attica or elsewhere was a question which he never thought of and which the oracle did not offer to solve for the athenians also have a festival which is called the grand festival of zeus meilichios or gracious viz the diasia it is celebrated outside the city and the whole people sacrifice not real victims but a number of bloodless offerings peculiar to the country however fancying he had chosen the right time he made the attempt
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.7,as soon as the athenians perceived it they flocked in one and all from the country and sat down and laid siege to the citadel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.8,but as time went on weary of the labour of blockade most of them departed the responsibility of keeping guard being left to the nine archons with plenary powers to arrange everything according to their good judgment it must be known that at that time most political functions were discharged by the nine archons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.9,meanwhile cylon and his besieged companions were distressed for want of food and water
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.10,accordingly cylon and his brother made their escape but the rest being hard pressed and some even dying of famine seated themselves as suppliants at the altar in the acropolis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.11,the athenians who were charged with the duty of keeping guard when they saw them at the point of death in the temple raised them up on the understanding that no harm should be done to them led them out and slew them some who as they passed by took refuge at the altars of the awful goddesses were despatched on the spot from this deed the men who killed them were called accursed and guilty against the goddess they and their descendants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.126.12,accordingly these cursed ones were driven out by the athenians driven out again by cleomenes of lacedaemon and an athenian faction the living were driven out and the bones of the dead were taken up thus they were cast out for all that they came back afterwards and their descendants are still in the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.127.1,this then was the curse that the lacedaemonians ordered them to drive out they were actuated primarily as they pretended by a care for the honor of the gods but they also knew that pericles son of xanthippus was connected with the curse on his mother s side and they thought that his banishment would materially advance their designs on athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.127.2,not that they really hoped to succeed in procuring this they rather thought to create a prejudice against him in the eyes of his countrymen from the feeling that the war would be partly caused by his misfortune
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.127.3,for being the most powerful man of his time and the leading athenian statesman he opposed the lacedaemonians in everything and would have no concessions but ever urged the athenians on to war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.1,the athenians retorted by ordering the lacedaemonians to drive out the curse of taenarus the lacedaemonians had once raised up some helot suppliants from the temple of poseidon at taenarus led them away and slain them for which they believe the great earthquake at sparta to have been a retribution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.2,the athenians also ordered them to drive out the curse of the goddess of the brazen house the history of which is as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.3,after pausanias the lacedaemonian had been recalled by the spartans from his command in the hellespont this is his first recall and had been tried by them and acquitted not being again sent out in a public capacity he took a galley of hermione on his own responsibility without the authority of the lacedaemonians and arrived as a private person in the hellespont he came ostensibly for the hellenic war really to carry on his intrigues with the king which he had begun before his recall being ambitious of reigning over hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.4,the circumstance which first enabled him to lay the king under an obligation and to make a beginning of the whole design was this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.5,some connections and kinsmen of the king had been taken in byzantium on its capture from the medes when he was first there after the return from cyprus these captives he sent off to the king without the knowledge of the rest of the allies the account being that they had escaped from him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.6,he managed this with the help of gongylus an eretrian whom he had placed in charge of byzantium and the prisoners he also gave gongylus a letter for the king the contents of which were as follows as was afterwards discovered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.128.7,pausanias the general of sparta anxious to do you a favour sends you these his prisoners of war i propose also with your approval to marry your daughter and to make sparta and the rest of hellas subject to you i may say that i think i am able to do this with your cooperation accordingly if any of this please you send a safe man to the sea through whom we may in future conduct our correspondence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.129.1,this was all that was revealed in the writing and xerxes was pleased with the letter he sent off artabazus son of pharnaces to the sea with orders to supersede megabates the previous governor in the satrapy of daskylion and to send over as quickly as possible to pausanias at byzantium a letter which he entrusted to him to show him the royal signet and to execute any commission which he might receive from pausanias on the king s matters with all care and fidelity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.129.2,artabazus on his arrival carried the king s orders into effect and sent over the letter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.129.3,which contained the following answer thus saith king xerxes to pausanias for the men whom you have saved for me across sea from byzantium an obligation is laid up for you in our house recorded forever and with your proposals i am well pleased let neither night nor day stop you from diligently performing any of your promises to me neither for cost of gold nor of silver let them be hindered nor yet for number of troops wherever it may be that their presence is needed but with artabazus an honorable man whom i send you boldly advance my objects and yours as may be most for the honor and interest of us both
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.130.1,before held in high honor by the hellenes as the hero of plataea pausanias after the receipt of this letter became prouder than ever and could no longer live in the usual style but went out of byzantium in a median dress was attended on his march through thrace by a bodyguard of medes and egyptians kept a persian table and was quite unable to contain his intentions but betrayed by his conduct in trifles what his ambition looked one day to enact on a grander scale
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.130.2,he also made himself difficult of access and displayed so violent a temper to every one without exception that no one could come near him indeed this was the principal reason why the confederacy went over to the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.131.1,the abovementioned conduct coming to the ears of the lacedaemonians occasioned his first recall and after his second voyage out in the ship of hermione without their orders he gave proofs of similar behavior besieged and expelled from byzantium by the athenians he did not return to sparta but news came that he had settled at colonae in the troad and was intriguing with the barbarians and that his stay there was for no good purpose and the ephors now no longer hesitating sent him a herald and a scytale with orders to accompany the herald or be declared a public enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.131.2,anxious above everything to avoid suspicion and confident that he could quash the charge by means of money he returned a second time to sparta at first thrown into prison by the ephors whose powers enable them to do this to the king he soon compromised the matter and came out again and offered himself for trial to any who wished to institute an inquiry concerning him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.132.1,now the spartans had no tangible proof against him neither his enemies nor the nation of that indubitable kind required for the punishment of a member of the royal family and at that moment in high office he being regent for his first cousin king pleistarchus leonidas son who was still a minor but by his contempt of the laws and imitation of the barbarians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.132.2,he gave grounds for much suspicion of his being discontented with things established all the occasions on which he had in any way departed from the regular customs were passed in review and it was remembered that he had taken upon himself to have inscribed on the tripod at delphi which was dedicated by the hellenes as the firstfruits of the spoil of the medes the following couplet the mede defeated great pausanias raisedthis monument that phoebus might be praised
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.132.3,at the time the lacedaemonians had at once erased the couplet and inscribed the names of the cities that had aided in the overthrow of the barbarian and dedicated the offering yet it was considered that pausanias had here been guilty of a grave offence which interpreted by the light of the attitude which he had since assumed gained a new significance and seemed to be quite in keeping with his present schemes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.132.4,besides they were informed that he was even intriguing with the helots and such indeed was the fact for he promised them freedom and citizenship if they would join him in insurrection and would help him to carry out his plans to the end
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.132.5,even now mistrusting the evidence even of the helots themselves the ephors would not consent to take any decided step against him in accordance with their regular custom towards themselves namely to be slow in taking any irrevocable resolve in the matter of a spartan citizen without indisputable proof at last it is said the person who was going to carry to artabazus the last letter for the king a man of argilus once the favorite and most trusty servant of pausanias turned informer alarmed by the reflection that none of the previous messengers had ever returned having counterfeited the seal in order that if he found himself mistaken in his surmises or if pausanias should ask to make some correction he might not be discovered he undid the letter and found the postscript that he had suspected viz an order to put him to death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.133.1,on being shown the letter the ephors now felt more certain still they wished to hear pausanias commit himself with their own ears accordingly the man went by appointment to taenarus as a suppliant and there built himself a hut divided into two by a partition within which he concealed some of the ephors and let them hear the whole matter plainly for pausanias came to him and asked him the reason of his suppliant position and the man reproached him with the order that he had written concerning him and one by one declared all the rest of the circumstances how he who had never yet brought him into any danger while employed as agent between him and the king was yet just like the mass of his servants to be rewarded with death admitting all this and telling him not to be angry about the matter pausanias gave him the pledge of raising him up from the temple and begged him to set off as quickly as possible and not to hinder the business in hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.134.1,the ephors listened carefully and then departed taking no action for the moment but having at last attained to certainty were preparing to arrest him in the city it is reported that as he was about to be arrested in the street he saw from the face of one of the ephors what he was coming for another too made him a secret signal and betrayed it to him from kindness setting off with a run for the temple of the goddess of the brazen house the enclosure of which was near at hand he succeeded in taking sanctuary before they took him and entering into a small chamber which formed part of the temple to avoid being exposed to the weather lay still there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.134.2,the ephors for the moment distanced in the pursuit afterwards took off the roof of the chamber and having made sure that he was inside shut him in barricaded the doors and staying before the place reduced him by starvation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.134.3,when they found that he was on the point of expiring just as he was in the chamber they brought him out of the temple while the breath was still in him and as soon as he was brought out he died
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.134.4,they were going to throw him into the kaiadas where they cast criminals but finally decided to inter him somewhere near but the god at delphi afterwards ordered the lacedaemonians to remove the tomb to the place of his death where he now lies in the consecrated ground as an inscription on a monument declares and as what had been done was a curse to them to give back two bodies instead of one to the goddess of the brazen house so they had two brazen statues made and dedicated them as a substitute for pausanias
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.135.1,accordingly the athenians retorted by telling the lacedaemonians to drive out what the god himself had pronounced to be a curse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.135.2,to return to the medism of pausanias matter was found in the course of the inquiry to implicate themistocles and the lacedaemonians accordingly sent envoys to the athenians and required them to punish him as they had punished pausanias the athenians consented to do so
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.135.3,but he had as it happened been ostracized and with a residence at argos was in the habit of visiting other parts of peloponnese so they sent with the lacedaemonians who were ready to join in the pursuit persons with instructions to take him wherever they found him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.136.1,but themistocles got scent of their intentions and fled from peloponnese to corcyra which was under obligations towards him but the corcyraeans alleged that they could not venture to shelter him at the cost of offending athens and lacedaemon and they conveyed him over to the continent opposite
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.136.2,pursued by the officers who hung on the report of his movements at a loss where to turn he was compelled to stop at the house of admetus the molossian king though they were not on friendly terms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.136.3,admetus happened not to be indoors but his wife to whom he made himself a suppliant instructed him to take their child in his arms and sit down by the hearth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.136.4,soon afterwards admetus came in and themistocles told him who he was and begged him not to revenge on themistocles in exile any opposition which his requests might have experienced from themistocles at athens indeed he was now far too low for his revenge retaliation was only honorable between equals besides his opposition to the king had only affected the success of a request not the safety of his person if the king were to give him up to the pursuers that he mentioned and the fate which they intended for him he would just be consigning him to certain death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.137.1,the king listened to him and raised him up with his son as he was sitting with him in his arms after the most effectual method of supplication and on the arrival of the lacedaemonians not long afterwards refused to give him up for anything they could say but sent him off by land to the other sea to pydna in alexander s dominions as he wished to go to the persian king
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.137.2,there he met with a merchantman on the point of starting for ionia going on board he was carried by a storm to the athenian squadron which was blockading naxos in his alarm he was luckily unknown to the people in the vessel he told the master who he was and what he was flying for and said that if he refused to save him he would declare that he was taking him for a bribe meanwhile their safety consisted in letting no one leave the ship until a favorable time for sailing should arise if he complied with his wishes he promised him a proper recompense the master acted as he desired and after lying to for a day a night out of the reach of the squadron at length arrived at ephesus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.137.3,after having rewarded him with a present of money as soon as he received some from his friends at athens and from his secret hoards at argos themistocles started inland with one of the coastpersians and sent a letter to king artaxerxes xerxes son who had just come to the throne
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.137.4,its contents were as follows i themistocles am come to you who did your house more harm than any of the hellenes when i was compelled to defend myself against your father s invasion harm however far surpassed by the good that i did him during his retreat which brought no danger for me but much for him for the past you are a good turn in my debt here he mentioned the warning sent to xerxes from salamis to retreat as well as his finding the bridges unbroken which as he falsely pretended was due to him for the present able to do you great service i am here pursued by the hellenes for my friendship for you however i desire a year s grace when i shall be able to declare in person the objects of my coming
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.138.1,it is said that the king approved his intention and told him to do as he said he employed the interval in making what progress he could in the study of the persian tongue and of the customs of the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.138.2,arrived at court at the end of the year he attained to very high consideration there such as no hellene has ever possessed before or since partly from his splendid antecedents partly from the hopes which he held out of effecting for him the subjugation of hellas but principally by the proof which experience daily gave of his capacity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.138.3,for themistocles was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius indeed in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled by his own native capacity alike unformed and unsupplemented by study he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation and the best prophet of the future even to its most distant possibilities an able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his practice he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment in matters in which he had no experience he could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future in fine whether we consider the extent of his natural powers or the slightness of his application this extraordinary man must be allowed to have surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.138.4,disease was the real cause of his death though there is a story of his having ended his life by poison on finding himself unable to fulfil his promises to the king
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.138.5,however this may be there is a monument to him in the marketplace of asiatic magnesia he was governor of the district the king having given him magnesia which brought in fifty talents a year for bread lampsacus which was considered to be the richest wine country for wine and myus for other provisions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.138.6,his bones it is said were conveyed home by his relatives in accordance with his wishes and interred in attic ground this was done without the knowledge of the athenians as it is against the law to bury in attica an outlaw for treason so ends the history of pausanias and themistocles the lacedaemonian and the athenian the most famous men of their time in hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.139.1,to return to the lacedaemonians the history of their first embassy the injunctions which it conveyed and the rejoinder which it provoked concerning the expulsion of the accursed persons have been related already it was followed by a second which ordered athens to raise the siege of potidaea and to respect the independence of aegina above all it gave her most distinctly to understand that war might be prevented by the revocation of the megara decree excluding the megarians from the use of athenian harbors and of the market of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.139.2,but athens was not inclined either to revoke the decree or to entertain their other proposals she accused the megarians of pushing their cultivation into the consecrated ground and the unenclosed land on the border and of harboring her runaway slaves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.139.3,at last an embassy arrived with the lacedaemonian ultimatum the ambassadors were rhamphias melesippus and agesander not a word was said on any of the old subjects there was simply this lacedaemon wishes the peace to continue and there is no reason why it should not if you would leave the hellenes independent upon this the athenians held an assembly and laid the matter before their consideration it was resolved to deliberate once for all on all their demands and to give them an answer
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.139.4,there were many speakers who came forward and gave their support to one side or the other urging the necessity of war or the revocation of the decree and the folly of allowing it to stand in the way of peace among them came forward pericles son of xanthippus the first man of his time at athens ablest alike in counsel and in action and gave the following advice
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.140.1,there is one principle athenians which i hold to through everything and that is the principle of no concession to the peloponnesians i know that the spirit which inspires men while they are being persuaded to make war is not always retained in action that as circumstances change resolutions change yet i see that now as before the same almost literally the same counsel is demanded of me and i put it to those of you who are allowing yourselves to be persuaded to support the national resolves even in the case of reverses or to forfeit all credit for their wisdom in the event of success for sometimes the course of things is as arbitrary as the plans of man indeed this is why we usually blame chance for whatever does not happen as we expected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.140.2,now it was clear before that lacedaemon entertained designs against us it is still more clear now the treaty provides that we shall mutually submit our differences to legal settlement and that we shall meanwhile each keep what we have yet the lacedaemonians never yet made us any such offer never yet would accept from us any such offer on the contrary they wish complaints to be settled by war instead of by negotiation and in the end we find them here dropping the tone of expostulation and adopting that of command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.140.3,they order us to raise the siege of potidaea to let aegina be independent to revoke the megara decree and they conclude with an ultimatum warning us to leave the hellenes independent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.140.4,i hope that you will none of you think that we shall be going to war for a trifle if we refuse to revoke the megara decree which appears in front of their complaints and the revocation of which is to save us from war or let any feeling of selfreproach linger in your minds as if you went to war for slight cause
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.140.5,why this trifle contains the whole seal and trial of your resolution if you give way you will instantly have to meet some greater demand as having been frightened into obedience in the first instance while a firm refusal will make them clearly understand that they must treat you more as equals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.1,make your decision therefore at once either to submit before you are harmed or if we are to go to war as i for one think we ought to do so without caring whether the ostensible cause be great or small resolved against making concessions or consenting to a precarious tenure of our possessions for all claims from an equal urged upon a neighbor as commands before any attempt at legal settlement be they great or be they small have only one meaning and that is slavery
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.2,as to the war and the resources of either party a detailed comparison will not show you the inferiority of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.3,personally engaged in the cultivation of their land without funds either private or public the peloponnesians are also without experience in long wars across sea from the strict limit which poverty imposes on their attacks upon each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.4,powers of this description are quite incapable of often manning a fleet or often sending out an army they cannot afford the absence from their homes the expenditure from their own funds and besides they have not command of the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.5,capital it must be remembered maintains a war more than forced contributions farmers are a class of men that are always more ready to serve in person than in purse confident that the former will survive the dangers they are by no means so sure that the latter will not be prematurely exhausted especially if the war last longer than they expect which it very likely will
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.6,in a single battle the peloponnesians and their allies may be able to defy all hellas but they are incapacitated from carrying on a war against a power different in character from their own by the want of the single councilchamber requisite to prompt and vigorous action and the substitution of a diet composed of various races in which every state possesses an equal vote and each presses its own ends a condition of things which generally results in no action at all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.141.7,the great wish of some is to avenge themselves on some particular enemy the great wish of others to save their own pocket slow in assembling they devote a very small fraction of the time to the consideration of any public object most of it to the prosecution of their own objects meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come of his neglect that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or that for him and so by the same notion being entertained by all separately the common cause imperceptibly decays
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.1,but the principal point is the hindrance that they will experience from want of money the slowness with which it comes in will cause delay but the opportunities of war wait for no man
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.2,again we need not be alarmed either at the possibility of their raising fortifications in attica or at their navy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.3,it would be difficult for any system of fortifications to establish a rival city even in time of peace much more surely in an enemy s country with athens just as much fortified against it as it against athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.4,while a mere post might be able to do some harm to the country by incursions and by the facilities which it would afford for desertion but can never prevent our sailing into their country and raising fortifications there and making reprisals with our powerful fleet
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.5,for our naval skill is of more use to us for service on land than their military skill for service at sea

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.7,if you who have been practising at it ever since the median invasion have not yet brought it to perfection is there any chance of anything considerable being effected by an agricultural unseafaring population who will besides be prevented from practising by the constant presence of strong squadrons of observation from athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.8,with a small squadron they might hazard an engagement encouraging their ignorance by numbers but the restraint of a strong force will prevent their moving and through want of practice they will grow more clumsy and consequently more timid
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.142.9,it must be kept in mind that seamanship just like anything else is a matter of art and will not admit of being taken up occasionally as an occupation for times of leisure on the contrary it is so exacting as to leave leisure for nothing else
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.143.1,even if they were to touch the moneys at olympia or delphi and try to seduce our foreign sailors by the temptation of higher pay that would only be a serious danger if we could not still be a match for them by embarking our own citizens and the aliens resident among us but in fact by this means we are always a match for them and best of all we have a larger and higher class of native coxswains and sailors among our own citizens than all the rest of hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.143.2,and to say nothing of the danger of such a step none of our foreign sailors would consent to become an outlaw from his country and to take service with them and their hopes for the sake of a few days high pay
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.143.3,this i think is a tolerably fair account of the position of the peloponnesians that of athens is free from the defects that i have criticized in them and has other advantages of its own which they can show nothing to equal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.143.4,if they march against our country we will sail against theirs and it will then be found that the desolation of the whole of attica is not the same as that of even a fraction of peloponnese for they will not be able to supply the deficiency except by a battle while we have plenty of land both on the islands and the continent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.143.5,the rule of the sea is indeed a great matter consider for a moment suppose that we were islanders can you conceive a more impregnable position well this in future should as far as possible be our conception of our position dismissing all thought of our land and houses we must vigilantly guard the sea and the city no irritation that we may feel for the former must provoke us to a battle with the numerical superiority of the peloponnesians a victory would only be succeeded by another battle against the same superiority a reverse involves the loss of our allies the source of our strength who will not remain quiet a day after we become unable to march against them we must cry not over the loss of houses and land but of men s lives since houses and land do not gain men but men them and if i had thought that i could persuade you i would have bid you go out and lay them waste with your own hands and show the peloponnesians that this at any rate will not make you submit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.144.1,i have many other reasons to hope for a favorable issue if you can consent not to combine schemes of fresh conquest with the conduct of the war and will abstain from willfully involving yourselves in other dangers indeed i am more afraid of our own blunders than of the enemy s devices
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.144.2,but these matters shall be explained in another speech as events require for the present dismiss these men with the answer that we allow megara the use of our market and harbours when the lacedaemonians suspend their alien acts in favour of us and our allies there being nothing in the treaty to prevent either one or the other that we will leave the cities independent if independent we found them when we made the treaty and when the lacedaemonians grant to their cities an independence not involving subservience to lacedaemonian interest but such as each severally may desire that we are willing to give the legal satisfaction which our agreements specify and that we shall not commence hostilities but shall resist those who do commence them this is an answer agreeable at once to the rights and the dignity of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.144.3,it must be thoroughly understood that war is a necessity but that the more readily we accept it the less will be the ardour of our opponents and that out of the greatest dangers communities and individuals acquire the greatest glory

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.145.1,such were the words of pericles the athenians persuaded of the wisdom of his advice voted as he desired and answered the lacedaemonians as he recommended both on the separate points and in the general they would do nothing on dictation but were ready to have the complaints settled in a fair and impartial manner by the legal method which the terms of the truce prescribed so the envoys departed home and did not return again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:1.146.1,these were the changes and differences existing between the rival powers before the war arising immediately from the affair at epidamnus and corcyra still intercourse continued in spite of them and mutual communication it was carried on without heralds but not without suspicion as events were occurring which were equivalent to a breach of the treaty and matter for war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.1.1,the war between the athenians and peloponnesians and the allies on either side now really begins for now all intercourse except through the medium of heralds ceased and hostilities were commenced and prosecuted without intermission the history follows the chronological order of events by summers and winters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.2.1,the thirty years truce which was entered into after the conquest of euboea lasted fourteen years in the fifteenth in the fortyeighth year of the priestessship of chrysis at argos in the ephorate of aenesias at sparta in the last month but two of the archonship of pythodorus at athens and six months after the battle of potidaea just at the beginning of spring a theban force a little over three hundred strong under the command of their boeotarchs pythangelus son of phyleides and diemporus son of onetorides about the first watch of the night made an armed entry into plataea a town of boeotia in alliance with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.2.2,the gates were opened to them by a plataean called naucleides who with his party had invited them in meaning to put to death the citizens of the opposite party bring over the city to thebes and thus obtain power for themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.2.3,this was arranged through eurymachus son of leontiades a person of great influence at thebes for plataea had always been at variance with thebes and the latter foreseeing that war was at hand wished to surprise her old enemy in time of peace before hostilities had actually broken out indeed this was how they got in so easily without being observed as no guard had been posted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.2.4,after the soldiers had grounded arms in the marketplace those who had invited them in wished them to set to work at once and go to their enemies houses this however the thebans refused to do but determined to make a conciliatory proclamation and if possible to come to a friendly understanding with the citizens their herald accordingly invited any who wished to resume their old place in the confederacy of their countrymen to ground arms with them for they thought that in this way the city would readily join them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.3.1,on becoming aware of the presence of the thebans within their gates and of the sudden occupation of the town the plataeans concluded in their alarm that more had entered than was really the case the night preventing their seeing them they accordingly came to terms and accepting the proposal made no movement especially as the thebans offered none of them any violence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.3.2,but somehow or other during the negotiations they discovered the scanty numbers of the thebans and decided that they could easily attack and overpower them the mass of the plataeans being averse to revolting from athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.3.3,at all events they resolved to attempt it digging through the party walls of the houses they thus managed to join each other without being seen going through the streets in which they placed wagons without the beasts in them to serve as a barricade and arranged everything else as seemed convenient for the occasion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.3.4,when everything had been done that circumstances permitted they watched their opportunity and went out of their houses against the enemy it was still night though daybreak was at hand in daylight it was thought that their attack would be met by men full of courage and on equal terms with their assailants while in darkness it would fall upon panicstricken troops who would also be at a disadvantage from their enemy s knowledge of the locality so they made their assault at once and came to close quarters as quickly as they could
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.1,the thebans finding themselves outwitted immediately closed up to repel all attacks made upon them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.2,twice or thrice they beat back their assailants but the men shouted and charged them the women and slaves screamed and yelled from the houses and pelted them with stones and tiles besides it had been raining hard all night and so at last their courage gave way and they turned and fled through the town most of the fugitives were quite ignorant of the right ways out and this with the mud and the darkness caused by the moon being in her last quarter and the fact that their pursuers knew their way about and could easily stop their escape proved fatal to many
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.3,the only gate open was the one by which they had entered and this was shut by one of the plataeans driving the spike of a javelin into the bar instead of the bolt so that even here there was no longer any means of exit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.4,they were now chased all over the town some got on the wall and threw themselves over in most cases with a fatal result one party managed to find a deserted gate and obtaining an axe from a woman cut through the bar but as they were soon observed only a few succeeded in getting out others were cut off in detail in different parts of the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.5,the most numerous and compact body rushed into a large building next to the city wall the doors on the side of the street happened to be open and the thebans fancied that they were the gates of the town and that there was a passage right through to the outside
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.6,the plataeans seeing their enemies in a trap now consulted whether they should set fire to the building and burn them just as they were or whether there was anything else that they could do with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.7,until at length these and the rest of the theban survivors found wandering about the town agreed to an unconditional surrender of themselves and their arms to the plataeans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.4.8,while such was the fate of the party in plataea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.1,the rest of the thebans who were to have joined them with all their forces before daybreak in case of anything miscarrying with the body that had entered received the news of the affair on the road and pressed forward to their succor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.2,now plataea is nearly eight miles from thebes and their march was delayed by the rain that had fallen in the night for the river asopus had risen and was not easy of passage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.3,and so having to march in the rain and being hindered in crossing the river they arrived too late and found the whole party either slain or captive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.4,when they learned what had happened there at once formed a design against the plataeans outside the city as the attack had been made in time of peace and was perfectly unexpected there were of course men and stock in the fields and the thebans wished if possible to have some prisoners to exchange against their countrymen in the town should any chance to have been taken alive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.5,such was their plan but the plataeans suspected their intention almost before it was formed and becoming alarmed for their fellowcitizens outside the town sent a herald to the thebans reproaching them for their unscrupulous attempt to seize their city in time of peace and warning them against any outrage on those outside should the warning be disregarded they threatened to put to death the men they had in their hands but added that on the thebans retiring from their territory they would surrender the prisoners to their friends
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.6,this is the theban account of the matter and they say that they had an oath given them the plataeans on the other hand do not admit any promise of an immediate surrender but make it contingent upon subsequent negotiation the oath they deny altogether
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.5.7,be this as it may upon the thebans retiring from their territory without committing any injury the plataeans hastily got in whatever they had in the country and immediately put the men to death the prisoners were a hundred and eighty in number eurymachus the person with whom the traitors had negotiated being one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.6.1,this done the plataeans sent a messenger to athens gave back the dead to the thebans under a truce and arranged things in the city as seemed best to meet the present emergency
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.6.2,the athenians meanwhile having had word of the affair sent them immediately after its occurrence had instantly seized all the boeotians in attica and sent a herald to the plataeans to forbid their proceeding to extremities with their theban prisoners without instructions from athens the news of the men s death had of course not arrived
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.6.3,the first messenger having left plataea just when the thebans entered it the second just after their defeat and capture so there was no later news thus the athenians sent their orders in ignorance of the facts and the herald on his arrival found the men slain
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.6.4,after this the athenians marched to plataea and brought in provisions and left a garrison in the place also taking away the women and children and such of the men as were least efficient
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.7.1,after the affair at plataea the treaty had been broken by an overt act and athens at once prepared for war as did also lacedaemon and her allies they resolved to send embassies to the king and to such other of the barbarian powers as either party could look to for assistance and tried to ally themselves with the independent states at home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.7.2,lacedaemon in addition to the existing marine gave orders to the states that had declared for her in italy and sicily to build vessels up to a grand total of five hundred the quota of each city being determined by its size and also to provide a specified sum of money till these were ready they were to remain neutral and to admit single athenian ships into their harbors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.7.3,athens on her part reviewed her existing confederacy and sent embassies to the places more immediately round peloponnese corcyra cephallenia acarnania and zacynthus perceiving that if these could be relied on she could carry the war all round peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.8.1,and if both sides nourished the boldest hopes and put forth their utmost strength for the war this was only natural zeal is always at its height at the commencement of an undertaking and on this particular occasion peloponnese and athens were both full of young men whose inexperience made them eager to take up arms while the rest of hellas stood straining with excitement at the conflict of its leading cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.8.2,everywhere predictions were being recited and oracles being chanted by such persons as collect them and this not only in the contending cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.8.3,further some while before this there was an earthquake at delos for the first time in the memory of the hellenes this was said and thought to be ominous of the events impending indeed nothing of the kind that happened was allowed to pass without remark
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.8.4,the good wishes of men made greatly for the lacedaemonians especially as they proclaimed themselves the liberators of hellas no private or public effort that could help them in speech or action was omitted each thinking that the cause suffered wherever he could not himself see to it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.8.5,so general was the indignation felt against athens whether by those who wished to escape from her empire or were apprehensive of being absorbed by it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.9.1,such were the preparations and such the feelings with which the contest opened the allies of the two belligerents were the following
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.9.2,these were the allies of lacedaemon all the peloponnesians within the isthmus except the argives and achaeans who were neutral pellene being the only achaean city that first joined in the war though her example was afterwards followed by the rest outside peloponnese the megarians locrians boeotians phocians ambraciots leucadians and anactorians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.9.3,of these ships were furnished by the corinthians megarians sycyonians pellenians eleans ambraciots and leucadians and cavalry by the boeotians phocians and locrians the other states sent infantry this was the lacedaemonian confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.9.4,that of athens comprised the chians lesbians plateans the messenians in naupactus most of the acarnanians the corcyraeans zacynthians and some tributary cities in the following countries viz caria upon the sea with her dorian neighbors ionia the hellespont the thracian towns the islands lying between peloponnese and crete towards the east and all the cyclades except melos and thera
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.9.5,of these ships were furnished by chios lesbos and corcyra infantry and money by the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.9.6,such were the allies of either party and their resources for the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.10.1,immediately after the affair at plataea lacedaemon sent round orders to the cities in peloponnese and the rest of her confederacy to prepare troops and the provisions requisite for a foreign campaign in order to invade attica
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.10.2,the several states were ready at the time appointed and assembled at the isthmus the contingent of each city being twothirds of its whole force
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.10.3,after the whole army had mustered the lacedaemonian king archidamus the leader of the expedition called together the generals of all the states and the principal persons and officers and exhorted them as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.1,peloponnesians and allies our fathers made many campaigns both within and without peloponnese and the elder men among us here are not without experience in war yet we have never set out with a larger force than the present and if our numbers and efficiency are remarkable so also is the power of the state against which we march
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.2,we ought not then to show ourselves inferior to our ancestors or unequal to our own reputation for the hopes and attention of all hellas are bent upon the present effort and its sympathy is with the enemy of the hated athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.3,therefore numerous as the invading army may appear to be and certain as some may think it that our adversary will not meet us in the field this is no sort of justification for the least negligence upon the march but the officers and men of each particular city should always be prepared for the advent of danger in their own quarters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.4,the course of war cannot be foreseen and its attacks are generally dictated by the impulse of the moment and where overweening selfconfidence has despised preparation a wise apprehension has often been able to make head against superior numbers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.5,not that confidence is out of place in an army of invasion but in an enemy s country it should also be accompanied by the precautions of apprehension troops will by this combination be best inspired for dealing a blow and best secured against receiving one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.6,in the present instance the city against which we are going far from being so impotent for defence is on the contrary most excellently equipped at all points so that we have every reason to expect that they will take the field against us and that if they have not set out already before we are there they will certainly do so when they see us in their territory wasting and destroying their property
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.7,for men are always exasperated at suffering injuries to which they are not accustomed and on seeing them inflicted before their very eyes and where least inclined for reflection rush with the greatest heat to action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.8,the athenians are the very people of all others to do this as they aspire to rule the rest of the world and are more in the habit of invading and ravaging their neighbors territory than of seeing their own treated in the like fashion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.11.9,considering therefore the power of the state against which we are marching and the greatness of the reputation which according to the event we shall win or lose for our ancestors and ourselves remember as you follow where you may be led to regard discipline and vigilance as of the first importance and to obey with alacrity the orders transmitted to you as nothing contributes so much to the credit and safety of an army as the union of large bodies by a single discipline
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.12.1,with this brief speech dismissing the assembly archidamus first sent off melesippus son of diacritus a spartan to athens in case she should be more inclined to submit on seeing the peloponnesians actually on the march
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.12.2,but the athenians did not admit him into the city or to their assembly pericles having already carried a motion against admitting either herald or embassy from the lacedaemonians after they had once marched out the herald was accordingly sent away without an audience and ordered to be beyond the frontier that same day in future if those who sent him had a proposition to make they must retire to their own territory before they dispatched embassies to athens an escort was sent with melesippus to prevent his holding communication with any one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.12.3,when he reached the frontier and was just going to be dismissed he departed with these words this day will be the beginning of great misfortunes to the hellenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.12.4,as soon as he arrived at the camp and archidamus learnt that the athenians had still no thoughts of submitting he at length began his march and advanced with his army into their territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.12.5,meanwhile the boeotians sending their contingent and cavalry to join the peloponnesian expedition went to plataea with the remainder and laid waste the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.1,while the peloponnesians were still mustering at the isthmus or on the march before they invaded attica pericles son of xanthippus one of the ten generals of the athenians finding that the invasion was to take place conceived the idea that archidamus who happened to be his friend might possibly pass by his estate without ravaging it this he might do either from a personal wish to oblige him or acting under instructions from lacedaemon for the purpose of creating a prejudice against him as had been before attempted in the demand for the expulsion of the accursed family he accordingly took the precaution of announcing to the athenians in the assembly that although archidamus was his friend yet this friendship should not extend to the detriment of the state and that in case the enemy should make his houses and lands an exception to the rest and not pillage them he at once gave them up to be public property so that they should not bring him into suspicion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.2,he also gave the citizens some advice on their present affairs in the same strain as before they were to prepare for the war and to carry in their property from the country they were not to go out to battle but to come into the city and guard it and get ready their fleet in which their real strength lay they were also to keep a tight rein on their allies the strength of athens being derived from the money brought in by their payments and success in war depending principally upon conduct and capital
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.3,here they had no reason to despond apart from other sources of income an average revenue of six hundred talents of silver was drawn from the tribute of the allies and there were still six thousand talents of coined silver in the acropolis out of nine thousand seven hundred that had once been there from which the money had been taken for the porch of the acropolis the other public buildings and for potidaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.4,this did not include the uncoined gold and silver in public and private offerings the sacred vessels for the processions and games the median spoils and similar resources to the amount of five hundred talents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.5,to this he added the treasures of the other temples these were by no means inconsiderable and might fairly be used nay if they were ever absolutely driven to it they might take even the gold ornaments of athena herself for the statue contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable this might be used for selfpreservation and must every penny of it be restored
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.6,such was their financial position surely a satisfactory one then they had an army of thirteen thousand heavy infantry besides sixteen thousand more in the garrisons and on home duty at athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.7,this was at first the number of men on guard in the event of an invasion it was composed of the oldest and youngest levies and the resident aliens who had heavy armor the phaleric wall ran for four miles before it joined that round the city and of this last nearly five had a guard although part of it was left without one viz that between the long wall and the phaleric then there were the long walls to piraeus a distance of some four miles and a half the outer of which was manned lastly the circumference of piraeus with munychia was nearly seven miles and a half only half of this however was guarded
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.8,pericles also showed them that they had twelve hundred horse including mounted archers with sixteen hundred archers unmounted and three hundred galleys fit for service
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.13.9,such were the resources of athens in the different departments when the peloponnesian invasion was impending and hostilities were being commenced pericles also urged his usual arguments for expecting a favorable issue to the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.14.1,the athenians listened to his advice and began to carry in their wives and children from the country and all their household furniture even to the woodwork of their houses which they took down their sheep and cattle they sent over to euboea and the adjacent islands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.14.2,but they found it hard to move as most of them had been always used to live in the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.15.1,from very early times this had been more the case with the athenians than with others under cecrops and the first kings down to the reign of theseus attica had always consisted of a number of independent townships each with its own townhall and magistrates except in times of danger the king at athens was not consulted in ordinary seasons they carried on their government and settled their affairs without his interference sometimes even they waged war against him as in the case of the eleusinians with eumolpus against erechtheus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.15.2,in theseus however they had a king of equal intelligence and power and one of the chief features in his organization of the country was to abolish the council chambers and magistrates of the petty cities and to merge them in the single councilchamber and townhall of the present capital individuals might still enjoy their private property just as before but they were henceforth compelled to have only one political center viz athens which thus counted all the inhabitants of attica among her citizens so that when theseus died he left a great state behind him indeed from him dates the synoecia or feast of union which is paid for by the state and which the athenians still keep in honor of the goddess
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.15.3,before this the city consisted of the present citadel and the district beneath it looking rather towards the south
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.15.4,this is shown by the fact that the temples the other deities besides that of athena are in the citadel and even those that are outside it are mostly situated in this quarter of the city as that of the olympian zeus of the pythian apollo of earth and of dionysus in the marshes the same in whose honor the older dionysia are to this day celebrated in the month of anthesterion not only by the athenians but also by their ionian descendants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.15.5,there are also other ancient temples in this quarter the fountain too which since the alteration made by the tyrants has been called enneacrounos or nine pipes but which when the spring was open went by the name of callirhoe or fairwater was in those days from being so near used for the most important offices indeed the old fashion of using the water before marriage and for other sacred purposes is still kept up
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.15.6,again from their old residence in that quarter the citadel is still known among athenians as the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.16.1,the athenians thus long lived scattered over attica in independent townships even after the centralization of theseus old habit still prevailed and from the early times down to the present war most athenians still lived in the country with their families and households and were consequently not at all inclined to move now especially as they had only just restored their establishments after the median invasion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.16.2,deep was their trouble and discontent at abandoning their houses and the hereditary temples of the ancient constitution and at having to change their habits of life and to bid farewell to what each regarded as his native city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.17.1,when they arrived at athens though a few had houses of their own to go to or could find an asylum with friends or relatives by far the greater number had to take up their dwelling in the parts of the city that were not built over and in the temples and chapels of the heroes except the acropolis and the temple of the eleusinian demeter and such other places as were always kept closed the occupation of the plot of ground lying below the citadel called the pelasgian had been forbidden by a curse and there was also an ominous fragment of a pythian oracle which said leave the pelasgian parcel desolate woe worth the day that men inhabit it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.17.2,yet this too was now built over in the necessity of the moment and in my opinion if the oracle proved true it was in the opposite sense to what was expected for the misfortunes of the state did not arise from the unlawful occupation but the necessity of the occupation from the war and though the god did not mention this he foresaw that it would be an evil day for athens in which the plot came to be inhabited
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.17.3,many also took up their quarters in the towers of the walls or wherever else they could for when they were all come in the city proved too small to hold them though afterwards they divided the long walls and a great part of piraeus into lots and settled there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.17.4,all this while great attention was being given to the war the allies were being mustered and an armament of a hundred ships equipped for peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.17.5,such was the state of preparation at athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.18.1,meanwhile the army of the peloponnesians was advancing the first town they came to in attica was oenoe where they were to enter the country sitting down before it they prepared to assault the wall with engines and otherwise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.18.2,oenoe standing upon the athenian and boeotian border was of course a walled town and was used as a fortress by the athenians in time of war so the peloponnesians prepared for their assault and wasted some valuable time before the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.18.3,this delay brought the gravest censure upon archidamus even during the levying of the war he had gained credit for weakness and athenian sympathies by the half measures he had advocated and after the army had assembled he had further injured himself in public estimation by his loitering at the isthmus and the slowness with which the rest of the march had been conducted but all this was as nothing to the delay at oenoe
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.18.4,during this interval the athenians were carrying in their property and it was the belief of the peloponnesians that a quick advance would have found everything still out had it not been for his procrastination
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.18.5,such was the feeling of the army towards archidamus during the siege but he it is said expected that the athenians would shrink from letting their land be wasted and would make their submission while it was still uninjured and this was why he waited
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.19.1,but after he had assaulted oenoe and every possible attempt to take it had failed as no herald came from athens he at last broke up his camp and invaded attica this was about eighty days after the theban attempt upon plataea just in the middle of summer when the corn was ripe and archidamus son of zeuxis king of lacedaemon was in command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.19.2,encamping in eleusis and the thriasian plain they began their ravages and putting to flight some athenian horse at a place called rheiti or the brooks they then advanced keeping mount aegaleus on their right through cropia until they reached acharnae the largest of the athenian demes or townships sitting down before it they formed a camp there and continued their ravages for a long while
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.20.1,the reason why archidamus remained in order of battle at acharnae during this incursion instead of descending into the plain is said to have been this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.20.2,he hoped that the athenians might possibly be tempted by the multitude of their youth and the unprecedented efficiency of their service to come out to battle and attempt to stop the devastation of their lands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.20.3,accordingly as they had not met him at eleusis or the thriasian plain he tried if they could be provoked to a sally by the spectacle of a camp at acharnae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.20.4,he thought the place itself a good position for encamping and it seemed likely that such an important part of the state as the three thousand heavy infantry of the acharnians would refuse to submit to the ruin of their property and would force a battle on the rest of the citizens on the other hand should the athenians not take the field during this incursion he could then fearlessly ravage the plain in future invasions and extend his advance up to the very walls of athens after the acharnians had lost their own property they would be less willing to risk themselves for that of their neighbors and so there would be division in the athenian counsels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.20.5,these were the motives of archidamus for remaining at acharnae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.21.1,in the meanwhile as long as the army was at eleusis and the thriasian plain hopes were still entertained of its not advancing any nearer it was remembered that pleistoanax son of pausanias king of lacedaemon had invaded attica with a peloponnesian army fourteen years before but had retreated without advancing farther than eleusis and thria which indeed proved the cause of his exile from sparta as it was thought he had been bribed to retreat
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.21.2,but when they saw the army at acharnae barely seven miles from athens they lost all patience the territory of athens was being ravaged before the very eyes of the athenians a sight which the young men had never seen before and the old only in the median wars and it was naturally thought a grievous insult and the determination was universal especially among the young men to sally forth and stop it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.21.3,knots were formed in the streets and engaged in hot discussion for if the proposed sally was warmly recommended it was also in some cases opposed oracles of the most various import were recited by the collectors and found eager listeners in one or other of the disputants foremost in pressing for the sally were the acharnians as constituting no small part of the army of the state and as it was their land that was being ravaged in short the whole city was in a most excited state pericles was the object of general indignation his previous counsels were totally forgotten he was abused for not leading out the army which he commanded and was made responsible for the whole of the public suffering
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.22.1,he meanwhile seeing anger and infatuation just now in the ascendant and confident of his wisdom in refusing a sally would not call either assembly or meeting of the people fearing the fatal results of a debate inspired by passion and not by prudence accordingly he addressed himself to the defence of the city and kept it as quiet as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.22.2,though he constantly sent out cavalry to prevent raids on the lands near the city from flying parties of the enemy there was a trifling affair at phrygia between a squadron of the athenian horse with the thessalians and the boeotian cavalry in which the former had rather the best of it until the heavy infantry advanced to the support of the boeotians when the thessalians and athenians were routed and lost a few men whose bodies however were recovered the same day without a truce the next day the peloponnesians set up a trophy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.22.3,ancient alliance brought the thessalians to the aid of athens those who came being the larisaeans pharsalians cranonians pyrasians gyrtonians and pheraeans the larisaean commanders were polymedes and aristonus two party leaders in larisa the pharsalian general was menon each of the other cities had also its own commander
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.23.1,in the meantime the peloponnesians as the athenians did not come out to engage them broke up from acharnae and ravaged some of the demes between mount parnes and brilessus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.23.2,while they were in attica the athenians sent off the hundred ships which they had been preparing round peloponnese with a thousand heavy infantry and four hundred archers on board under the command of carcinus son of xenotimus proteas son of epicles and socrates son of antigenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.23.3,this armament weighed anchor and started on its cruise and the peloponnesians after remaining in attica as long as their provisions lasted retired through boeotia by a different road to that by which they had entered as they passed oropus they ravaged the territory of graea which is held by the oropians from athens and reaching peloponnese broke up to their respective cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.24.1,after they had retired the athenians set guards by land and sea at the points at which they intended to have regular stations during the war they also resolved to set apart a special fund of a thousand talents from the monies in the acropolis this was not to be spent but the current expenses of the war were to be otherwise provided for if any one should move or put to the vote a proposition for using the money for any purpose whatever except that of defending the city in the event of the enemy bringing a fleet to make an attack by sea it should be a capital offence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.24.2,with this sum of money they also set aside a special fleet of one hundred galleys the best ships of each year with their captains none of these was to be used except with the money and against the same peril should such peril arise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.25.1,meanwhile the athenians in the hundred ships round peloponnese reinforced by a corcyraean squadron of fifty vessels and some others of the allies in those parts cruised about the coasts and ravaged the country among other places they landed in laconia and made an assault upon methone there being no garrison in the place and the wall being weak
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.25.2,but it so happened that brasidas son of tellis a spartan was in command of a guard for the defence of the district hearing of the attack he hurried with a hundred heavy infantry to the assistance of the besieged and dashing through the army of the athenians which was scattered over the country and had its attention turned to the wall threw himself into methone he lost a few men in making good his entrance but saved the place and won the thanks of sparta by his exploit being thus the first officer who obtained this notice during the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.25.3,the athenians at once weighed anchor and continued their cruise touching at pheia in elis they ravaged the country for two days and defeated a picked force of three hundred men that had come from the vale of elis and the immediate neighborhood to the rescue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.25.4,but a stiff squall came down upon them and not liking to face it in a place where there was no harbor most of them got on board their ships and doubling point ichthys sailed into the port of pheia in the meantime the messenians and some others who could not get on board marched over by land and took pheia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.25.5,the fleet afterwards sailed round and picked them up and then put to sea pheia being evacuated as the main army of the eleans had now come up the athenians continued their cruise and ravaged other places on the coast
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.26.1,about the same time the athenians sent thirty ships to cruise round locris and also to guard euboea cleopompus son of clinias being in command

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.27.1,during the summer the athenians also expelled the aeginetans with their wives and children from aegina on the ground of their having been the chief agents in bringing the war upon them besides aegina lies so near peloponnese that it seemed safer to send colonists of their own to hold it and shortly afterwards the settlers were sent out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.27.2,the banished aeginetans found an asylum in thyrea which was given to them by lacedaemon not only on account of her quarrel with athens but also because the aeginetans had laid her under obligations at the time of the earthquake and the revolt of the helots the territory of thyrea is on the frontier of argolis and laconia reaching down to the sea those of the aeginetans who did not settle here were scattered over the rest of hellas

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.1,during the same summer nymphodorus son of pythes an abderite whose sister sitalces had married was made their proxenus by the athenians and sent for to athens they had hitherto considered him their enemy but he had great influence with sitalces and they wished this prince to become their ally sitalces was the son of teres and king of the thracians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.2,teres the father of sitalces was the first to establish the great kingdom of the odrysians on a scale quite unknown to the rest of thrace a large portion of the thracians being independent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.3,this teres is in no way related to tereus who married pandion s daughter procne from athens nor indeed did they belong to the same part of thrace tereus lived in daulis part of what is now called phocis but which at that time was inhabited by thracians it was in this land that the women perpetrated the outrage upon itys and many of the poets when they mention the nightingale call it the daulian bird besides pandion in contracting an alliance for his daughter would consider the advantages of mutual assistance and would naturally prefer a match at the above moderate distance to the journey of many days which separates athens from the odrysians again the names are different and this teres was king of the odrysians the first by the way who attained to any power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.4,sitalces his son was now sought as an ally by the athenians who desired his aid in the reduction of the thracian towns and of perdiccas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.5,coming to athens nymphodorus concluded the alliance with sitalces and made his son sadocus an athenian citizen and promised to finish the war in thrace by persuading sitalces to send the athenians a force of thracian horse and targeteers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.6,he also reconciled them with perdiccas and induced them to restore therme to him upon which perdiccas at once joined the athenians and phormio in an expedition against the chalcidians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.29.7,thus sitalces son of teres king of the thracians and perdiccas son of alexander king of the macedonians became allies of athens

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.34.1,in the same winter the athenians gave a funeral at the public cost to those who had first fallen in this war it was a custom of their ancestors and the manner of it is as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.34.2,three days before the ceremony the bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which has been erected and their friends bring to their relatives such offerings as they please

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.34.8,meanwhile these were the first that had fallen and pericles son of xanthippus was chosen to pronounce their eulogium when the proper time arrived he advanced from the sepulchre to an elevated platform in order to be heard by as many of the crowd as possible and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.35.1,most of my predecessors in this place have commended him who made this speech part of the law telling us that it is well that it should be delivered at the burial of those who fall in battle for myself i should have thought that the worth which had displayed itself in deeds would be sufficiently rewarded by honors also shown by deeds such as you now see in this funeral prepared at the people s cost and i could have wished that the reputations of many brave men were not to be imperilled in the mouth of a single individual to stand or fall according as he spoke well or ill for it is hard to speak properly upon a subject where it is even difficult to convince your hearers that you are speaking the truth

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.36.4,that part of our history which tells of the military achievements which gave us our several possessions or of the ready valor with which either we or our fathers stemmed the tide of hellenic or foreign aggression is a theme too familiar to my hearers for me to dilate on and i shall therefore pass it by but what was the road by which we reached our position what the form of government under which our greatness grew what the national habits out of which it sprang these are questions which i may try to solve before i proceed to my panegyric upon these men since i think this to be a subject upon which on the present occasion a speaker may properly dwell and to which the whole assemblage whether citizens or foreigners may listen with advantage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.37.1,our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves its administration favors the many instead of the few this is why it is called a democracy if we look to the laws they afford equal justice to all in their private differences if to social standing advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit nor again does poverty bar the way if a man is able to serve the state he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.37.2,the freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life there far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive although they inflict no positive penalty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.37.3,but all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens against this fear is our chief safeguard teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws particularly such as regard the protection of the injured whether they are actually on the statute book or belong to that code which although unwritten yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.38.1,further we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself from business we celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round and the elegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of pleasure and helps to banish the spleen
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.38.2,while the magnitude of our city draws the produce of the world into our harbor so that to the athenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his own

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.39.2,in proof of this it may be noticed thatthe lacedaemonians do not invade our country alone but bring with them all their confederates while we athenians advance unsupported into the territory of a neighbor and fighting upon a foreign soil usually vanquish with ease men who are defending their homes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.39.3,our united force was never yet encountered by any enemy because we have at once to attend to our marine and to despatch our citizens by land upon a hundred different services so that wherever they engage with some such fraction of our strength a success against a detachment is magnified into a victory over the nation and a defeat into a reverse suffered at the hands of our entire people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.39.4,and yet if with habits not of labor but of ease and courage not of art but of nature we are still willing to encounter danger we have the double advantage of escaping the experience of hardships in anticipation and of facing them in the hour of need as fearlessly as those who are never free from them nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of admiration
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.40.1,we cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy wealth we employ more for use than for show and place the real disgrace of poverty not in owning to the fact but in declining the struggle against it

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.42.3,for there is justice in the claim that steadfastness in his country s battles should be as a cloak to cover a man s other imperfections since the good action has blotted out the bad and his merit as a citizen more than outweighed his demerits as an individual
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.42.4,but none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger no holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards they joyfully determined to accept the risk to make sure of their vengeance and to let their wishes wait and while committing to hope the uncertainty of final success in the business before them they thought fit to act boldly and trust in themselves thus choosing to die resisting rather than to live submitting they fled only from dishonor but met danger face to face and after one brief moment while at the summit of their fortune escaped not from their fear but from their glory

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.47.2,in the first days of summer the lacedaemonians and their allies with twothirds of their forces as before invaded attica under the command of archidamus son of zeuxidamus king of lacedaemon and sat down and laid waste the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.47.3,not many days after their arrival in attica the plague first began to show itself among the athenians it was said that it had broken out in many places previously in the neighborhood of lemnos and elsewhere but a pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere remembered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.47.4,neither were the physicians at first of any service ignorant as they were of the proper way to treat it but they died themselves the most thickly as they visited the sick most often nor did any human art succeed any better supplications in the temples divinations and so forth were found equally futile till the overwhelming nature of the disaster at last put a stop to them altogether
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.48.1,it first began it is said in the parts of ethiopia above egypt and thence descended into egypt and libya and into most of the king s country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.48.2,suddenly falling upon athens it first attacked the population in piraeus which was the occasion of their saying that the peloponnesians had poisoned the reservoirs there being as yet no wells there and afterwards appeared in the upper city when the deaths became much more frequent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.48.3,all speculation as to its origin and its causes if causes can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance i leave to other writers whether lay or professional for myself i shall simply set down its nature and explain the symptoms by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student if it should ever break out again this i can the better do as i had the disease myself and watched its operation in the case of others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.1,that year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free from sickness and such few cases as occurred all determined in this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.2,as a rule however there was no ostensible cause but people in good health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head and redness and inflammation in the eyes the inward parts such as the throat or tongue becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid breath
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.3,these symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness after which the pain soon reached the chest and produced a hard cough when it fixed in the stomach it upset it and discharges of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued accompanied by very great distress
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.4,in most cases also an ineffectual retching followed producing violent spasms which in some cases ceased soon after in others much later
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.5,externally the body was not very hot to the touch nor pale in its appearance but reddish livid and breaking out into small pustules and ulcers but internally it burned so that the patient could not bear to have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description or indeed to be otherwise than stark naked what they would have liked best would have been to throw themselves into cold water as indeed was done by some of the neglected sick who plunged into the raintanks in their agonies of unquenchable thirst though it made no difference whether they drank little or much
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.6,besides this the miserable feeling of not being able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them the body meanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its height but held out to a marvel against its ravages so that when they succumbed as in most cases on the seventh or eighth day to the internal inflammation they had still some strength in them but if they passed this stage and the disease descended further into the bowels inducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe diarrhea this brought on a weakness which was generally fatal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.7,for the disorder first settled in the head ran its course from thence through the whole of the body and even where it did not prove mortal it still left its mark on the extremities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.49.8,for it settled in the privy parts the fingers and the toes and many escaped with the loss of these some too with that of their eyes others again were seized with an entire loss of memory on their first recovery and did not know either themselves or their friends
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.50.1,but while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all description and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to endure it was still in the following circumstance that its difference from all ordinary disorders was most clearly shown all the birds and beasts that prey upon human bodies either abstained from touching them though there were many lying unburied or died after tasting them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.50.2,in proof of this it was noticed that birds of this kind actually disappeared they were not about the bodies or indeed to be seen at all but of course the effects which i have mentioned could best be studied in a domestic animal like the dog
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.51.1,such then if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which were many and peculiar were the general features of the distemper meanwhile the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders or if any case occurred it ended in this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.51.2,some died in neglect others in the midst of every attention no remedy was found that could be used as a specific for what did good in one case did harm in another
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.51.3,strong and weak constitutions proved equally incapable of resistance all alike being swept away although dieted with the utmost precaution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.51.4,by far the most terrible feature in the malady was the dejection which ensued when anyone felt himself sickening for the despair into which they instantly fell took away their power of resistance and left them a much easier prey to the disorder besides which there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep through having caught the infection in nursing each other this caused the greatest mortality
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.51.5,on the one hand if they were afraid to visit each other they perished from neglect indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse on the other if they ventured to do so death was the consequence this was especially the case with such as made any pretensions to goodness honor made them unsparing of themselves in their attendance in their friends houses where even the members of the family were at last worn out by the moans of the dying and succumbed to the force of the disaster
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.51.6,yet it was with those who had recovered from the disease that the sick and the dying found most compassion these knew what it was from experience and had now no fear for themselves for the same man was never attacked twice never at least fatally and such persons not only received the congratulations of others but themselves also in the elation of the moment half entertained the vain hope that they were for the future safe from any disease whatsoever
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.52.1,an aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the country into the city and this was especially felt by the new arrivals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.52.2,as there were no houses to receive them they had to be lodged at the hot season of the year in stifling cabins where the mortality raged without restraint the bodies of dying men lay one upon another and halfdead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains in their longing for water
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.52.3,the sacred places also in which they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons that had died there just as they were for as the disaster passed all bounds men not knowing what was to become of them became utterly careless of everything whether sacred or profane
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.52.4,all the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and they buried the bodies as best they could many from want of the proper appliances through so many of their friends having died already had recourse to the most shameless sepultures sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile they threw their own dead body upon the stranger s pyre and ignited it sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of another that was burning and so went off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.53.1,nor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its origin to the plague men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner and not just as they pleased seeing the rapid transitions produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those who before had nothing succeeding to their property
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.53.2,so they resolved to spend quickly and enjoy themselves regarding their lives and riches as alike things of a day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.53.3,perseverance in what men called honor was popular with none it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to attain the object but it was settled that present enjoyment and all that contributed to it was both honorable and useful
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.53.4,fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them as for the first they judged it to be just the same whether they worshipped them or not as they saw all alike perishing and for the last no one expected to live to be brought to trial for his offences but each felt that a far severer sentence had been already passed upon them all and hung ever over their heads and before this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy life a little
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.54.1,such was the nature of the calamity and heavily did it weigh on the athenians death raging within the city and devastation without
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.54.2,among other things which they remembered in their distress was very naturally the following verse which the old men said had long ago been uttered a dorian war shall come and with it death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.54.3,so a dispute arose as to whether dearth and not death had not been the word in the verse but at the present juncture it was of course decided in favor of the latter for the people made their recollection fit in with their sufferings i fancy however that if another dorian war should ever afterwards come upon us and a dearth should happen to accompany it the verse will probably be read accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.54.4,the oracle also which had been given to the lacedaemonians was now remembered by those who knew of it when the god was asked whether they should go to war he answered that if they put their might into it victory would be theirs and that he would himself be with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.54.5,with this oracle events were supposed to tally for the plague broke out so soon as the peloponnesians invaded attica and never entering peloponnese not at least to an extent worth noticing committed its worst ravages at athens and next to athens at the most populous of the other towns such was the history of the plague
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.55.1,after ravaging the plain the peloponnesians advanced into the paralian region as far as laurium where the athenian silver mines are and first laid waste the side looking towards peloponnese next that which faces euboea and andros
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.55.2,but pericles who was still general held the same opinion as in the former invasion and would not let the athenians march out against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.56.1,however while they were still in the plain and had not yet entered the paralian land he had prepared an armament of a hundred ships for peloponnese and when all was ready put out to sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.56.2,on board the ships he took four thousand athenian heavy infantry and three hundred cavalry in horse transports then for the first time made out of old galleys fifty chian and lesbian vessels also joining in the expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.56.3,when this athenian armament put out to sea they left the peloponnesians in attica in the paralian region
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.56.4,arriving at epidaurus in peloponnese they ravaged most of the territory and even had hopes of taking the town by an assault in this however they were not successful
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.56.5,putting out from epidaurus they laid waste the territory of troezen halieis and hermione all towns on the coast of peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.56.6,and thence sailing to prasiai a maritime town in laconia ravaged part of its territory and took and sacked the place itself after which they returned home but found the peloponnesians gone and no longer in attica
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.57.1,during the whole time that the peloponnesians were in attica and the athenians on the expedition in their ships men kept dying of the plague both in the armament and in athens indeed it was actually asserted that the departure of the peloponnesians was hastened by fear of the disorder as they heard from deserters that it was in the city and also could see the burials going on
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.57.2,yet in this invasion they remained longer than in any other and ravaged the whole country for they were about forty days in attica
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.58.1,the same summer hagnon son of nicias and cleopompus son of clinias the colleagues of pericles took the armament of which he had lately made use and went off upon an expedition against the chalcidians in the direction of thrace and potidaea which was still under siege as soon as they arrived they brought up their engines against potidaea and tried every means of taking it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.58.2,but did not succeed either in capturing the city or in doing anything else worthy of their preparations for the plague attacked them here also and committed such havoc as to cripple them completely even the previously healthy soldiers of the former expedition catching the infection from hagnon s troops while phormio and the sixteen hundred men whom he commanded only escaped by being no longer in the neighborhood of the chalcidians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.58.3,the end of it was that hagnon returned with his ships to athens having lost one thousand and fifty out of four thousand heavy infantry in about forty days though the soldiers stationed there before remained in the country and carried on the siege of potidaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.59.1,after the second invasion of the peloponnesians a change came over the spirit of the athenians their land had now been twice laid waste and war and pestilence at once pressed heavy upon them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.59.2,they began to find fault with pericles as the author of the war and the cause of all their misfortunes and became eager to come to terms with lacedaemon and actually sent ambassadors thither who did not however succeed in their mission their despair was now complete and all vented itself upon pericles
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.59.3,when he saw them exasperated at the present turn of affairs and acting exactly as he had anticipated he called an assembly being it must be remembered still general with the double object of restoring confidence and of leading them from these angry feelings to a calmer and more hopeful state of mind he accordingly came forward and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.1,i was not unprepared for the indignation of which i have been the object as i know its causes and i have called an assembly for the purpose of reminding you upon certain points and of protesting against your being unreasonably irritated with me or cowed by your sufferings
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.2,i am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of private citizens than any individual wellbeing coupled with public humiliation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.3,a man may be personally ever so well off and yet if his country be ruined he must be ruined with it whereas a flourishing commonwealth always affords chances of salvation to unfortunate individuals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.4,since then a state can support the misfortunes of private citizens while they cannot support hers it is surely the duty of everyone to be forward in her defence and not like you to be so confounded with your domestic afflictions as to give up all thoughts of the common safety and to blame me for having counselled war and yourselves for having voted it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.5,and yet if you are angry with me it is with one who as i believe is second to no man either in knowledge of the proper policy or in the ability to expound it and who is moreover not only a patriot but an honest one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.6,a man possessing that knowledge without that faculty of exposition might as well have no idea at all on the matter if he had both these gifts but no love for his country he would be but a cold advocate for her interests while were his patriotism not proof against bribery everything would go for a price
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.60.7,so that if you thought that i was even moderately distinguished for these qualities when you took my advice and went to war there is certainly no reason now why i should be charged with having done wrong
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.61.1,for those of course who have a free choice in the matter and whose fortunes are not at stake war is the greatest of follies but if the only choice was between submission with loss of independence and danger with the hope of preserving that independence in such a case it is he who will not accept the risk that deserves blame not he who will
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.61.2,i am the same man and do not alter it is you who change since in fact you took my advice while unhurt and waited for misfortune to repent of it and the apparent error of my policy lies in the infirmity of your resolution since the suffering that it entails is being felt by every one among you while its advantage is still remote and obscure to all and a great and sudden reverse having befallen you your mind is too much depressed to persevere in your resolves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.61.3,for before what is sudden unexpected and least within calculation the spirit quails and putting all else aside the plague has certainly been an emergency of this kind
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.61.4,born however as you are citizens of a great state and brought up as you have been with habits equal to your birth you should be ready to face the greatest disasters and still to keep unimpaired the lustre of your name for the judgment of mankind is as relentless to the weakness that falls short of a recognized renown as it is jealous of the arrogance that aspires higher than its due cease then to grieve for your private afflictions and address yourselves instead to the safety of the commonwealth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.62.1,if you shrink before the exertions which the war makes necessary and fear that after all they may not have a happy result you know the reasons by which i have often demonstrated to you the groundlessness of your apprehension if those are not enough i will now reveal an advantage arising from the greatness of your dominion which i think has never yet suggested itself to you which i never mentioned in my previous speeches and which has so bold a sound that i should scarce adventure it now were it not for the unnatural depression which i see around me
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.62.2,you perhaps think that your empire extends only over your allies i will declare to you the truth the visible field of action has two parts land and sea in the whole of one of these you are completely supreme not merely as far as you use it at present but also to what further extent you may think fit in fine your naval resources are such that your vessels may go where they please without the king or any other nation on earth being able to stop them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.62.3,so that although you may think it a great privation to lose the use of your land and houses still you must see that this power is something widely different and instead of fretting on their account you should really regard them in the light of the gardens and other accessories that embellish a great fortune and as in comparison of little moment you should know too that liberty preserved by your efforts will easily recover for us what we have lost while the knee once bowed even what you have will pass from you your fathers receiving these possessions not from others but from themselves did not let slip what their labor had acquired but delivered them safe to you and in this respect at least you must prove yourselves their equals remembering that to lose what one has got is more disgraceful than to be baulked in getting and you must confront your enemies not merely with spirit but with disdain

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.66.1,during the same summer the lacedaemonians and their allies made an expedition with a hundred ships against zacynthus an island lying off the coast of elis peopled by a colony of achaeans from peloponnese and in alliance with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.66.2,there were a thousand lacedaemonian heavy infantry on board and cnemus a spartan as admiral they made a descent from their ships and ravaged most of the country but as the inhabitants would not submit they sailed back home

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.1,about the same time towards the close of the summer the ambraciot forces with a number of barbarians that they had raised marched against the amphilochian argos and the rest of that country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.2,the origin of their enmity against the argives was this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.3,this argos and the rest of amphilochia were colonized by amphilochus son of amphiaraus dissatisfied with the state of affairs at home on his return thither after the trojan war he built this city in the ambracian gulf and named it argos after his own country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.4,this was the largest town in amphilochia and its inhabitants the most powerful
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.5,under the pressure of misfortune many generations afterwards they called in the ambraciots their neighbors on the amphilochian border to join their colony and it was by this union with the ambraciots that they learnt their present hellenic speech the rest of the amphilochians being barbarians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.6,after a time the ambraciots expelled the argives and held the city themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.7,upon this the amphilochians gave themselves over to the acarnanians and the two together called the athenians who sent them phormio as general and thirty ships upon whose arrival they took argos by storm and made slaves of the ambraciots and the amphilochians and acarnanians inhabited the town in common
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.8,after this began the alliance between the athenians and acarnanians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.68.9,the enmity of the ambraciots against the argives thus commenced with the enslavement of their citizens and afterwards during the war they collected this armament among themselves and the chaonians and other of the neighboring barbarians arrived before argos they became masters of the country but not being successful in their attacks upon the town returned home and dispersed among their different peoples
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.69.1,such were the events of the summer the ensuing winter the athenians sent twenty ships round peloponnese under the command of phormio who stationed himself at naupactus and kept watch against any one sailing in or out of corinth and the crissaean gulf six others went to caria and lycia under melesander to collect tribute in those parts and also to prevent the peloponnesian privateers from taking up their station in those waters and molesting the passage of the merchantmen from phaselis and phoenicia and the adjoining continent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.69.2,however melesander going up the country into lycia with a force of athenians from the ships and the allies was defeated and killed in battle with the loss of a number of his troops
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.70.1,the same winter the potidaeans at length found themselves no longer able to hold out against their besiegers the inroads of the peloponnesians into attica had not had the desired effect of making the athenians raise the siege provisions there were none left and so far had distress for food gone in potidaea that besides a number of other horrors instances had even occurred of the people having eaten one another so in this extremity they at last made proposals for capitulating to the athenian generals in command against them xenophon son of euripides hestiodorus son of aristocleides and phanomachus son of callimachus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.70.2,the generals accepted their proposals seeing the sufferings of the army in so exposed a position besides which the state had already spent two thousand talents upon the siege
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.70.3,the terms of the capitulation were as follows a free passage out for themselves their children wives and auxiliaries with one garment apiece the women with two and a fixed sum of money for their journey
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.70.4,under this treaty they went out to chalcidice and other places according as was in their power the athenians however blamed the generals for granting terms without instructions from home being of opinion that the place would have had to surrender at discretion they afterwards sent settlers of their own to potidae and colonized it such were the events of the winter and so ended the second year of this war of which thucydides was the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.71.1,the next summer the peloponnesians and their allies instead of invading attica marched against plataea under the command of archidamus son of zeuxidamus king of the lacedaemonians he had encamped his army and was about to lay waste the country when the plataeans hastened to send envoys to him and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.71.2,archidamus and lacedaemonians in invading the plataean territory you do what is wrong in itself and worthy neither of yourselves nor of the fathers who begot you pausanias son of cleombrotus your countryman after freeing hellas from the medes with the help of those hellenes who were willing to undertake the risk of the battle fought near our city offered sacrifice to zeus the liberator in the marketplace of plataea and calling all the allies together restored to the plataeans their city and territory and declared it independent and inviolate against aggression or conquest should any such be attempted the allies present were to help according to their power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.71.3,your fathers rewarded us thus for the courage and patriotism that we displayed at that perilous epoch but you do just the contrary coming with our bitterest enemies the thebans to enslave us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.71.4,we appeal therefore to the gods to whom the oaths were then made to the gods of your ancestors and lastly to those of our country and call upon you to refrain from violating our territory or transgressing the oaths and to let us live independent as pausanias decreed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.72.1,the plataeans had got thus far when they were cut short by archidamus saying there is justice plataeans in what you say if you act up to your words according to the grant of pausanias continue to be independent yourselves and join in freeing those of your fellowcountrymen who after sharing in the perils of that period joined in the oaths to you and are now subject to the athenians for it is to free them and the rest that all this provision and war has been made i could wish that you would share our labors and abide by the oaths yourselves if this is impossible do what we have already required of you remain neutral enjoying your own join neither side but receive both as friends neither as allies for the war with this we shall be satisfied
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.72.2,such were the words of archidamus the plataeans after hearing what he had to say went into the city and acquainted the people with what had passed and presently returned for answer that it was impossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting the athenians with whom their children and wives now were besides which they had their fears for the town after his departure what was to prevent the athenians from coming and taking it out of their hands or the thebans who would be included in the oaths from taking advantage of the proposed neutrality to make a second attempt to seize the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.72.3,upon these points he tried to reassure them by saying you have only to deliver over the city and houses to us lacedaemonians to point out the boundaries of your land the number of your fruittrees and whatever else can be numerically stated and yourselves to withdraw wherever you like as long as the war shall last when it is over we will restore to you whatever we received and in the interim hold it in trust and keep it in cultivation paying you a sufficient allowance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.73.1,when they had heard what he had to say they reentered the city and after consulting with the people said that they wished first to acquaint the athenians with this proposal and in the event of their approving to accede to it in the meantime they asked him to grant them a truce and not to lay waste their territory he accordingly granted a truce for the number of days requisite for the journey and meanwhile abstained from ravaging their territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.73.2,the plataean envoys went to athens and consulted with the athenians and returned with the following message to those in the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.73.3,the athenians say plataeans that they never hitherto since we became their allies on any occasion abandoned us to an enemy nor will they now neglect us but will help us according to their ability and they adjure you by the oaths which your fathers swore to keep the alliance unaltered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.74.1,on the delivery of this message by the envoys the plataeans resolved not to be unfaithful to the athenians but to endure if it must be seeing their lands laid waste and any other trials that might come to them and not to send out again but to answer from the wall that it was impossible for them to do as the lacedaemonians proposed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.74.2,as soon as be had received this answer king archidamus proceeded first to make a solemn appeal to the gods and heroes of the country in words following ye gods and heroes of the plataean territory be my witnesses that not as aggressors originally nor until these had first departed from the common oath did we invade this land in which our fathers offered you their prayers before defeating the medes and which you made auspicious to the hellenic arms nor shall we be aggressors in the measures to which we may now resort since we have made many fair proposals but have not been successful graciously accord that those who were the first to offend may be punished for it and that vengeance may be attained by those who would righteously inflict it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.75.1,after this appeal to the gods archidamus put his army in motion first he enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruittrees which they cut down to prevent further egress from plataea next day they threw up a mound against the city hoping that the largeness of the force employed would insure the speedy reduction of the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.75.2,they accordingly cut down timber from cithaeron and built it up on either side laying it like latticework to serve as a wall to keep the mound from spreading abroad and carried to it wood and stones and earth and whatever other material might help to complete it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.75.3,they continued to work at the mound for seventy days and nights without intermission being divided into relief parties to allow of some being employed in carrying while others took sleep and refreshment the lacedaemonian officer attached to each contingent keeping the men to the work
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.75.4,but the plataeans observing the progress of the mound constructed a wall of wood and fixed it upon that part of the city wall against which the mound was being erected and built up bricks inside it which they took from the neighboring houses
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.75.5,the timbers served to bind the building together and to prevent its becoming weak as it advanced in height it had also a covering of skins and hides which protected the woodwork against the attacks of burning missiles and allowed the men to work in safety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.75.6,thus the wall was raised to a great height and the mound opposite made no less rapid progress the plataeans also thought of another expedient they pulled out part of the wall upon which the mound abutted and carried the earth into the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.76.1,discovering this the peloponnesians twisted up clay in wattles of reed and threw it into the breach formed in the mound in order to give it consistency and prevent its being carried away like the soil
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.76.2,stopped in this way the plataeans changed their mode of operation and digging a mine from the town calculated their way under the mound and began to carry off its material as before this went on for a long while without the enemy outside finding it out so that for all they threw on the top their mound made no progress in proportion being carried away from beneath and constantly settling down in the vacuum
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.76.3,but the plataeans fearing that even thus they might not be able to hold out against the superior numbers of the enemy had yet another invention they stopped working at the large building in front of the mound and starting at either end of it inside from the old low wall built a new one in the form of a crescent running in towards the town in order that in the event of the great wall being taken this might remain and the enemy have to throw up a fresh mound against it and as they advanced within might not only have their trouble over again but also be exposed to missiles on their flanks
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.76.4,while raising the mound the peloponnesians also brought up engines against the city one of which was brought up upon the mound against the great building and shook down a good piece of it to the no small alarm of the plataeans others were advanced against different parts of the wall but were lassoed and broken by the plataeans who also hung up great beams by long iron chains from either extremity of two poles laid on the wall and projecting over it and drew them up at an angle whenever any point was threatened by the engine and loosing their hold let the beam go with its chains slack so that it fell with a run and snapped off the nose of the battering ram
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.77.1,after this the peloponnesians finding that their engines effected nothing and that their mound was met by the counterwork concluded that their present means of offence were unequal to the taking of the city and prepared for its circumvallation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.77.2,first however they determined to try the effects of fire and see whether they could not with the help of a wind burn the town as it was not a large one indeed they thought of every possible expedient by which the place might be reduced without the expense of a blockade
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.77.3,they accordingly brought faggots of brushwood and threw them from the mound first into the space between it and the wall and this soon becoming full from the number of hands at work they next heaped the faggots up as far into the town as they could reach from the top and then lighted the wood by setting fire to it with sulphur and pitch
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.77.4,the consequence was a fire greater than any one had ever yet seen produced by human agency though it could not of course be compared to the spontaneous conflagrations sometimes known to occur through the wind rubbing the branches of a mountain forest together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.77.5,and this fire was not only remarkable for its magnitude but was also at the end of so many perils within an ace of proving fatal to the plataeans a great part of the town became entirely inaccessible and had a wind blown upon it in accordance with the hopes of the enemy nothing could have saved them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.77.6,as it was there is also a story of heavy rain and thunder having come on by which the fire was put out and the danger averted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.78.1,failing in this last attempt the peloponnesians left a portion of their forces on the spot dismissing the rest and built a wall of circumvallation round the town dividing the ground among the various cities present a ditch being made within and without the lines from which they got their bricks
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.78.2,all being finished by about the rising of arcturus they left men enough to man half the wall the rest being manned by the boeotians and drawing off their army dispersed to their several cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.78.3,the plataeans had before sent off their wives and children and oldest men and the mass of the noncombatants to athens so that the number of the besieged left in the place comprised four hundred of their own citizens eighty athenians and a hundred and ten women to bake their bread
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.78.4,this was the sum total at the commencement of the siege and there was no one else within the walls bond or free such were the arrangements made for the blockade of plataea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.79.1,the same summer and simultaneously with the expedition against plataea the athenians marched with two thousand heavy infantry and two hundred horse against the chalcidians in the direction of thrace and the bottiaeans just as the corn was getting ripe under the command of xenophon son of euripides with two colleagues
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.79.2,arriving before spartolus in bottiaea they destroyed the corn and had some hopes of the city coming over through the intrigues of a faction within but those of a different way of thinking had sent to olynthus and a garrison of heavy infantry and other troops arrived accordingly these issuing from spartolus were engaged by the athenians in front of the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.79.3,the chalcidian heavy infantry and some auxiliaries with them were beaten and retreated into spartolus but the chalcidian horse and light troops defeated the horse and light troops of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.79.4,the chalcidians had already a few targeteers from crusis and presently after the battle were joined by some others from olynthus

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.79.6,whenever the athenians advanced their adversary gave way pressing them with missiles the instant they began to retire the chalcidian horse also riding up and charging them just as they pleased at last caused a panic amongst them and routed and pursued them to a great distance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.79.7,the athenians took refuge in potidaea and afterwards recovered their dead under truce and returned to athens with the remnant of their army four hundred and thirty men and all the generals having fallen the chalcidians and bottiaeans set up a trophy took up their dead and dispersed to their several cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.1,the same summer not long after this the ambraciots and chaonians being desirous of reducing the whole of acarnania and detaching it from athens persuaded the lacedaemonians to equip a fleet from their confederacy and send a thousand heavy infantry to acarnania representing that if a combined movement were made by land and sea the coast acarnanians would be unable to march and the conquest of zacynthus and cephallenia easily following on the possession of acarnania the cruise round peloponnese would be no longer so convenient for the athenians besides which there was a hope of taking naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.2,the lacedaemonians accordingly at once sent off a few vessels with cnemus who was still high admiral and the heavy infantry on board and sent round orders for the fleet to equip as quickly as possible and sail to leucas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.3,the corinthians were the most forward in the business the ambraciots being a colony of theirs while the ships from corinth sicyon and the neighborhood were getting ready and those from leucas anactorium and ambracia which had arrived before were waiting for them at leucas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.4,cnemus and his thousand heavy infantry had run into the gulf giving the slip to phormio the commander of the athenian squadron stationed off naupactus and began at once to prepare for the land expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.5,the hellenic troops with him consisted of the ambraciots leucadians and anactorians and the thousand peloponnesians with whom he came the barbarian of a thousand chaonians who belonging to a nation that has no king were led by photius and nicanor the two members of the royal family to whom the chieftainship for that year had been confided with the chaonians came also some thesprotians like them without a king

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.7,there were also a thousand macedonians sent by perdiccas without the knowledge of the athenians but they arrived too late
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.80.8,with this force cnemus set out without waiting for the fleet from corinth passing through the territory of amphilochian argos and sacking the open village of limnaea they advanced to stratus the acarnanian capital this once taken the rest of the country they felt convinced would speedily follow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.1,the acarnanians finding themselves invaded by a large army by land and from the sea threatened by a hostile fleet made no combined attempt at resistance but remained to defend their homes and sent for help to phormio who replied that when a fleet was on the point of sailing from corinth it was impossible for him to leave naupactus unprotected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.2,the peloponnesians meanwhile and their allies advanced upon stratus in three divisions with the intention of encamping near it and attempting the wall by force if they failed to succeed by negotiation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.3,the order of march was as follows the center was occupied by the chaonians and the rest of the barbarians with the leucadians and anactorians and their followers on the right and cnemus with the peloponnesians and ambraciots on the left each division being a long way off from and sometimes even out of sight of the others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.4,the hellenes advanced in good order keeping a lookout till they encamped in a good position but the chaonians filled with selfconfidence and having the highest character for courage among the tribes of that part of the continent without waiting to occupy their camp rushed on with the rest of the barbarians in the idea that they should take the town by assault and obtain the sole glory of the enterprise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.5,while they were coming on the stratians becoming aware how things stood and thinking that the defeat of this division would considerably dishearten the hellenes behind it occupied the environs of the town with ambuscades and as soon as they approached engaged them at close quarters from the city and the ambuscades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.6,a panic seizing the chaonians great numbers of them were slain and as soon as they were seen to give way the rest of the barbarians turned and fled
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.7,owing to the distance by which their allies had preceded them neither of the hellenic divisions knew anything of the battle but fancied they were hastening on to encamp
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.81.8,however when the flying barbarians broke in upon them they opened their ranks to receive them brought their divisions together and stopped quiet where they were for the day the stratians not offering to engage them as the rest of the acarnanians had not yet arrived but contenting themselves with slinging at them from a distance which distressed them greatly as there was no stirring without their armor the acarnanians would seem to excel in this mode of warfare
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.82.1,as soon as night fell cnemus hastily drew off his army to the river anapus about nine miles from stratus recovering his dead next day under truce and being there joined by the friendly oeniadae fell back upon their city before the enemy s reinforcements came up from hence each returned home and the stratians set up a trophy for the battle with the barbarians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.83.1,meanwhile the fleet from corinth and the rest of the confederates in the crissaean gulf which was to have cooperated with cnemus and prevented the coast acarnanians from joining their countrymen in the interior was disabled from doing so by being compelled about the same time as the battle at stratus to fight with phormio and the twenty athenian vessels stationed at naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.83.2,for they were watched as they coasted along out of the gulf by phormio who wished to attack in the open sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.83.3,but the corinthians and allies had started for acarnania without any idea of fighting at sea and with vessels more like transports for carrying soldiers besides which they never dreamed of the twenty athenian ships venturing to engage their fortyseven however while they were coasting along their own shore there were the athenians sailing along in line with them and when they tried to cross over from patrae in achaea to the mainland on the other side on their way to acarnania they saw them again coming out from chalcis and the river evenus to meet them they slipped from their moorings in the night but were observed and were at length compelled to fight in mid passage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.83.4,each state that contributed to the armament had its own general the corinthian commanders were machaon isocrates and agatharchidas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.83.5,the peloponnesians ranged their vessels in as large a circle as possible without leaving an opening with the prows outside and the sterns in and placed within all the small craft in company and their five best sailors to issue out at a moment s notice and strengthen any point threatened by the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.84.1,the athenians formed in line sailed round and round them and forced them to contract their circle by continually brushing past and making as though they would attack at once having been previously cautioned by phormio not to do so till he gave the signal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.84.2,his hope was that the peloponnesians would not retain their order like a force on shore but that the ships would fall foul of one another and the small craft cause confusion and if the wind should blow from the gulf in expectation of which he kept sailing round them and which usually rose towards morning they would not he felt sure remain steady an instant he also thought that it rested with him to attack when he pleased as his ships were better sailors and that an attack timed by the coming of the wind would tell best
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.84.3,when the wind came down the enemy s ships were now in a narrow space and what with the wind and the small craft dashing against them at once fell into confusion ship fell foul of ship while the crews were pushing them off with poles and by their shouting swearing and struggling with one another made captains orders and boatswains cries alike inaudible and through being unable for want of practice to clear their oars in the rough water prevented the vessels from obeying their helmsmen properly at this moment phormio gave the signal and the athenians attacked sinking first one of the admirals they then disabled all they came across so that no one thought of resistance for the confusion but fled for patrae and dyme in achaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.84.4,the athenians gave chase and captured twelve ships and taking most of the men out of them sailed to molycrium and after setting up a trophy on the promontory of rhium and dedicating a ship to poseidon returned to naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.84.5,as for the peloponnesians they at once sailed with their remaining ships along the coast from dyme and patrae to cyllene the eleian arsenal where cnemus and the ships from leucas that were to have joined them also arrived after the battle of stratus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.85.1,the lacedaemonians now sent to the fleet to cnemus three commissioners timocrates brasidas and lycophron with orders to prepare to engage again with better fortune and not to be driven from the sea by a few vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.85.2,for they could not at all account for their discomfiture the less so as it was their first attempt at sea and they fancied that it was not that their marine was so inferior but that there had been misconduct somewhere not considering the long experience of the athenians as compared with the little practice which they had had themselves the commissioners were accordingly sent in anger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.85.3,as soon as they arrived they set to work with cnemus to order ships from the different states and to put those which they already had in fighting order
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.85.4,meanwhile phormio sent word to athens of their preparations and his own victory and desired as many ships as possible to be speedily sent to him as he stood in daily expectation of a battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.85.5,twenty were accordingly sent but instructions were given to their commander to go first to crete for nicias a cretan of gortys who was proxenus of the athenians had persuaded them to sail against cydonia promising to procure the reduction of that hostile town his real wish being to oblige the polichnitans neighbors of the cydonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.85.6,he accordingly went with the ships to crete and accompanied by the polichnitans laid waste the lands of the cydonians and what with adverse winds and stress of weather wasted no little time there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.86.1,while the athenians were thus detained in crete the peloponnesians in cyllene got ready for battle and coasted along to panormus in achaea where their land army had come to support them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.86.2,phormio also coasted along to molycrian rhium and anchored outside it with twenty ships the same as he had fought with before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.86.3,this rhium was friendly to the athenians the other in peloponnese lies opposite to it the sea between them is about threequarters of a mile broad and forms the mouth of the crissaean gulf
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.86.4,at this the achaean rhium not far off panormus where their army lay the peloponnesians now cast anchor with seventyseven ships when they saw the athenians do so
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.86.5,for six or seven days they remained opposite each other practising and preparing for the battle the one resolved not to sail out of the rhia into the open sea for fear of the disaster which had already happened to them the other not to sail into the straits thinking it advantageous to the enemy to fight in the narrows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.86.6,at last cnemus and brasidas and the rest of the peloponnesian commanders being desirous of bringing on a battle as soon as possible before reinforcements should arrive from athens and noticing that the men were most of them cowed by the previous defeat and out of heart for the business first called them together and encouraged them as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.1,peloponnesians the late engagement which may have made some of you afraid of the one now in prospect really gives no just ground for apprehension
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.2,preparation for it as you know there was little enough and the object of our voyage was not so much to fight at sea as an expedition by land besides this the chances of war were largely against us and perhaps also inexperience had something to do with our failure in our first naval action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.3,it was not therefore cowardice that produced our defeat nor ought the determination which force has not quelled but which still has a word to say with its adversary to lose its edge from the result of an accident but admitting the possibility of a chance miscarriage we should know that brave hearts must be always brave and while they remain so can never put forward inexperience as an excuse for misconduct
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.4,nor are you so behind the enemy in experience as you are ahead of him in courage and although the science of your opponents would if valor accompanied it have also the presence of mind to carry out at an emergency the lesson it has learnt yet a faint heart will make all art powerless in the face of danger for fear takes away presence of mind and without valor art is useless
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.5,against their superior experience set your superior daring and against the fear induced by defeat the fact of your having been then unprepared
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.6,remember too that you have always the advantage of superior numbers and of engaging off your own coast supported by your heavy infantry and as a rule numbers and equipment give victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.7,at no point therefore is defeat likely and as for our previous mistakes the very fact of their occurrence will teach us better for the future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.8,steersmen and sailors may therefore confidently attend to their several duties none quitting the station assigned to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.87.9,as for ourselves we promise to prepare for the engagement at least as well as your previous commanders and to give no excuse for any one misconducting himself should any insist on doing so he shall meet with the punishment he deserves while the brave shall be honored with the appropriate rewards of valor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.88.1,the peloponnesian commanders encouraged their men after this fashion phormio meanwhile being himself not without fears for the courage of his men and noticing that they were forming in groups among themselves and were alarmed at the odds against them desired to call them together and give them confidence and counsel in the present emergency
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.88.2,he had before continually told them and had accustomed their minds to the idea that there was no numerical superiority that they could not face and the men themselves had long been persuaded that athenians need never retire before any quantity of peloponnesian vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.88.3,at the moment however he saw that they were dispirited by the sight before them and wishing to refresh their confidence called them together and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.1,i see my men that you are frightened by the number of the enemy and i have accordingly called you together not liking you to be afraid of what is not really terrible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.2,in the first place the peloponnesians already defeated and not even themselves thinking that they are a match for us have not ventured to meet us on equal terms but have equipped this multitude of ships against us next as to that upon which they most rely the courage which they suppose constitutional to them their confidence here only arises from the success which their experience in land service usually gives them and which they fancy will do the same for them at sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.3,but this advantage will in all justice belong to us on this element if to them on that as they are not superior to us in courage but we are each of us more confident according to our experience in our particular department
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.4,besides as the lacedaemonians use their supremacy over the allies to promote their own glory they are most of them being brought into danger against their will or they would never after such a decided defeat have ventured upon a fresh engagement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.5,you need not therefore be afraid of their dash you on the contrary inspire a much greater and better founded alarm both because of your late victory and also of their belief that we should not face them unless about to do something worthy of a success so signal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.6,an adversary numerically superior like the one before us comes into action trusting more to strength than to resolution while he who voluntarily confronts tremendous odds must have very great internal resources to draw upon for these reasons the peloponnesians fear our irrational audacity more than they would ever have done a more commensurate preparation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.7,besides many armaments have before now succumbed to an inferior through want of skill or sometimes of courage neither of which defects certainly are ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.8,as to the battle it shall not be if i can help it in the strait nor will i sail in there at all seeing that in a contest between a number of clumsily managed vessels and a small fast wellhandled squadron want of sea room is an undoubted disadvantage one cannot run down an enemy properly without having a sight of him a good way off nor can one retire at need when pressed one can neither break the line nor return upon his rear the proper tactics for a fast sailor but the naval action necessarily becomes a land one in which numbers must decide the matter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.9,for all this i will provide as far as can be do you stay at your posts by your ships and be sharp at catching the word of command the more so as we are observing one another from so short a distance and in action think order and silence all important qualities useful in war generally and in naval engagements in particular and behave before the enemy in a manner worthy of your past exploits
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.10,the issues you will fight for are great to destroy the naval hopes of the peloponnesians or to bring nearer to the athenians their fears for the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.89.11,and i may once more remind you that you have defeated most of them already and beaten men do not face a danger twice with the same determination
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.90.1,such was the exhortation of phormio the peloponnesians finding that the athenians did not sail into the gulf and the narrows in order to lead them in whether they wished it or not put out at dawn and forming four abreast sailed inside the gulf in the direction of their own country the right wing leading as they had lain at anchor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.90.2,in this wing were placed twenty of their best sailors so that in the event of phormio thinking that their object was naupactus and coasting along thither to save the place the athenians might not be able to escape their onset by getting outside their wing but might be cut off by the vessels in question
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.90.3,as they expected phormio in alarm for the place at that moment emptied of its garrison as soon as he saw them put out reluctantly and hurriedly embarked and sailed along shore the messenian land forces moving along also to support him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.90.4,the peloponnesians seeing him coasting along with his ships in single file and by this inside the gulf and close in shore as they so much wished at one signal tacked suddenly and bore down in line at their best speed on the athenians hoping to cut off the whole squadron
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.90.5,the eleven leading vessels however escaped the peloponnesian wing and its sudden movement and reached the more open water but the rest were overtaken as they tried to run through driven ashore and disabled such of the crews being slain as had not swum out of them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.90.6,some of the ships the peloponnesians lashed to their own and towed off empty one they took with the men in it others were just being towed off when they were saved by the messenians dashing into the sea with their armor and fighting from the decks that they had boarded
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.91.1,thus far victory was with the peloponnesians and the athenian fleet destroyed the twenty ships in the right wing being meanwhile in chase of the eleven athenian vessels that had escaped their sudden movement and reached the more open water these with the exception of one ship all outsailed them and got safe into naupactus and forming close in shore opposite the temple of apollo with their prows facing the enemy prepared to defend themselves in case the peloponnesians should sail in shore against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.91.2,after a while the peloponnesians came up chanting the paean for their victory as they sailed on the single athenian ship remaining being chased by a leucadian far ahead of the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.91.3,but there happened to be a merchantman lying at anchor in the roadstead which the athenian ship found time to sail round and struck the leucadian in chase amidships and sank her
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.91.4,an exploit so sudden and unexpected produced a panic among the peloponnesians and having fallen out of order in the excitement of victory some of them dropped their oars and stopped their way in order to let the main body come up an unsafe thing to do considering how near they were to the enemy s prows while others ran aground in the shallows in their ignorance of the localities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.1,elated at this incident the athenians at one word gave a cheer and dashed at the enemy who embarrassed by his mistakes and the disorder in which he found himself only stood for an instant and then fled for panormus whence he had put out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.2,the athenians following on his heels took the six vessels nearest them and recovered those of their own which had been disabled close in shore and taken in tow at the beginning of the action they killed some of the crews and took some prisoners
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.3,on board the leucadian which went down off the merchantman was the lacedaemonian timocrates who killed himself when the ship was sunk and was cast up in the harbor of naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.4,the athenians on their return set up a trophy on the spot from which they had put out and turned the day and picking up the wrecks and dead that were on their shore gave back to the enemy their dead under truce
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.5,the peloponnesians also set up a trophy as victors for the defeat inflicted upon the ships they had disabled in shore and dedicated the vessel which they had taken at achaean rhium side by side with the trophy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.6,after this apprehensive of the reinforcement expected from athens all except the leucadians sailed into the crissaean gulf for corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.92.7,not long after their retreat the twenty athenian ships which were to have joined phormio before the battle arrived at naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.93.1,thus the summer ended winter was now at hand but before dispersing the fleet which had retired to corinth and the crissaean gulf cnemus brasidas and the other peloponnesian captains allowed themselves to be persuaded by the megarians to make an attempt upon piraeus the port of athens which from her decided superiority at sea had been naturally left unguarded and open
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.93.2,their plan was as follows the men were each to take their oar cushion and rowlock thong and going overland from corinth to the sea on the athenian side to get to megara as quickly as they could and launching forty vessels which happened to be in the docks at nisaea to sail at once to piraeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.93.3,there was no fleet on the lookout in the harbor and no one had the least idea of the enemy attempting a surprise while an open attack would it was thought never be deliberately ventured on or if in contemplation would be speedily known at athens their plan formed the next step was to put it in execution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.93.4,arriving by night and launching the vessels from nisaea they sailed not to piraes as they had originally intended being afraid of the risk besides which there was some talk of a wind having stopped them but to the point of salamis that looks towards megara where there was a fort and a squadron of three ships to prevent anything sailing in or out of megara this fort they assaulted and towed off the galleys empty and surprising the inhabitants began to lay waste the rest of the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.94.1,meanwhile fire signals were raised to alarm athens and a panic ensued there as serious as any that occurred during the war the idea in the city was that the enemy had already sailed into piraeus in piraeus it was thought that they had taken salamis and might at any moment arrive in the port as indeed might easily have been done if their hearts had been a little firmer certainly no wind would have prevented them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.94.2,as soon as day broke the athenians assembled in full force launched their ships and embarking in haste and uproar went with the fleet to salamis while their soldiery mounted guard in piraeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.94.3,the peloponnesians on becoming aware of the coming relief after they had overrun most of salamis hastily sailed off with their plunder and captives and the three ships from fort budorum to nisaea the state of their ships also causing them some anxiety as it was a long while since they had been launched and they were not watertight arrived at megara they returned back on foot to corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.94.4,the athenians finding them no longer at salamis sailed back themselves and after this made arrangements for guarding piraeus more diligently in future by closing the harbors and by other suitable precautions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.95.1,about the same time at the beginning of this winter sitalces son of teres the odrysian king of thrace made an expedition against perdiccas son of alexander king of macedonia and the chalcidians in the neighborhood of thrace his object being to enforce one promise and fulfil another
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.95.2,on the one hand perdiccas had made him a promise when hard pressed at the commencement of the war upon condition that sitalces should reconcile the athenians to him and not attempt to restore his brother and enemy the pretender philip but had not offered to fulfil his engagement on the other he sitalces on entering into alliance with the athenians had agreed to put an end to the chalcidian war in thrace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.95.3,these were the two objects of his invasion with him he brought amyntas the son of philip whom he destined for the throne of macedonia and some athenian envoys then at his court on this business and hagnon as general for the athenians were to join him against the chalcidians with a fleet and as many soldiers as they could get together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.96.1,beginning with the odrysians he first called out the thracian tribes subject to him between mounts haemus and rhodope and the euxine and hellespont next the getae beyond haemus and the other hordes settled south of the danube in the neighborhood of the euxine who like the getae border on the scythians and are armed in the same manner being all mounted archers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.96.2,besides these he summoned many of the hill thracian independent swordsmen called dii and mostly inhabiting mount rhodope some of whom came as mercenaries others as volunteers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.96.3,also the agrianes and laeaeans and the rest of the paeonian tribes in his empire at the confines of which these lay extending up to the laeaean paeonians and the river strymon which flows from mount scombrus through the country of the agrianes and laeaeans there the empire of sitalces ends and the territory of the independent paeonians begins
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.96.4,bordering on the triballi also independent were the treres and tilataeans who dwell to the north of mount scombrus and extend towards the setting sun as far as the river oskius this river rises in the same mountains as the nestus and hebrus a wild and extensive range connected with rhodope
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.97.1,the empire of the odrysians extended along the seaboard from abdera to the mouth of the danube in the euxine the navigation of this coast by the shortest route takes a merchantman four days and four nights with a wind astern the whole way by land an active man travelling by the shortest road can get from abdera to the danube in eleven days
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.97.2,such was the length of its coast line inland from byzantium to the laeaeans and the strymon the farthest limit of its extension into the interior it is a journey of thirteen days for an active man
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.97.3,the tribute from all the barbarian districts and the hellenic cities taking what they brought in under seuthes the successor of sitalces who raised it to its greatest height amounted to about four hundred talents in gold and silver there were also presents in gold and silver to a no less amount besides stuff plain and embroidered and other articles made not only for the king but also for the odrysian lords and nobles
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.97.4,for there was here established a custom opposite to that prevailing in the persian kingdom namely of taking rather than giving more disgrace being attached to not giving when asked than to asking and being refused and although this prevailed elsewhere in thrace it was practised most extensively among the powerful odrysians it being impossible to get anything done without a present
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.97.5,it was thus a very powerful kingdom in revenue and general prosperity surpassing all in europe between the ionian gulf and the euxine and in numbers and military resources coming decidedly next to the scythians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.97.6,with whom indeed no people in europe can bear comparison there not being even in asia any nation singly a match for them if unanimous though of course they are not on a level with other races in general intelligence and the arts of civilized life
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.98.1,it was the master of this empire that now prepared to take the field when everything was ready he set out on his march for macedonia first through his own dominions next over the desolate range of cercine that divides the sintians and paeonians crossing by a road which he had made by felling the timber on a former campaign against the latter people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.98.2,passing ever these mountains with the paeonians on his right and the sintians and maedians on the left he finally arrived at doberus in paeonia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.98.3,losing none of his army on the march except perhaps by sickness but receiving some augmentations many of the independent thracians volunteering to join him in the hope of plunder so that the whole is said to have formed a grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.98.4,most of this was infantry though there was about a third cavalry furnished principally by the odrysians themselves and next to them by the getae the most warlike of the infantry were the independent swordsmen who came down from rhodope the rest of the mixed multitude that followed him being chiefly formidable by their numbers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.99.1,assembling in doberus they prepared for descending from the heights upon lower macedonia where the dominions of perdiccas lay
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.99.2,for the lyncestae elimiots and other tribes more inland though macedonians by blood and allies and dependents of their kindred still have their own separate governments
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.99.3,the country on the sea coast now called macedonia was first acquired by alexander the father of perdiccas and his ancestors originally temenids from argos this was effected by the expulsion from pieria of the pierians who afterwards inhabited phagres and other places under mount pangaeus beyond the strymon indeed the country between pangaeus and the sea is still called the pierian gulf of the bottiaeans at present neighbors of the chalcidians from bottia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.99.4,and by the acquisition in paeonia of a narrow strip along the river axius extending to pella and the sea the district of mygdonia between the axius and the strymon being also added by the expulsion of the edonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.99.5,from eordia also were driven the eordians most of whom perished though a few of them still live round physca and the almopians from almopia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.99.6,these macedonians also conquered places belonging to the other tribes which are still theirs anthemus crestonia bisaltia and much of macedonia proper the whole is now called macedonia and at the time of the invasion of sitalces perdiccas alexander s son was the reigning king
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.100.1,these macedonians unable to take the field against so numerous an invader shut themselves up in such strong places and fortresses as the country possessed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.100.2,of these there was no great number most of those now found in the country having been erected subsequently by archelaus the son of perdiccas on his accession who also cut straight roads and otherwise put the kingdom on a better footing as regards horses heavy infantry and other war material than had been done by all the eight kings that preceded him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.100.3,advancing from doberus the thracian host first invaded what had been once philip s government and took idomene by assault gortynia atalanta and some other places by negotiation these last coming over for love of philip s son amyntas then with sitalces laying siege to europus and failing to take it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.100.4,he next advanced into the rest of macedonia to the left of pella and cyrrhus not proceeding beyond this into bottia and pieria but staying to lay waste mygdonia crestonia and anthemus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.100.5,the macedonians never even thought of meeting him with infantry but the thracian host was as opportunity offered attacked by handfuls of their horse which had been reinforced from their allies in the interior armed with cuirasses and excellent horsemen wherever these charged they overthrew all before them but ran considerable risk in entangling themselves in the masses of the enemy and so finally desisted from these efforts deciding that they were not strong enough to venture against numbers so superior
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.101.1,meanwhile sitacles opened negotiations with perdiccas on the objects of his expedition and finding that the athenians not believing that he would come did not appear with their fleet though they sent presents and envoys despatched a large part of his army against the chalcidians and bottiaeans and cutting them up inside their walls laid waste their country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.101.2,while he remained in these parts the people farther south such as the thessalians and the hellenes as far as thermopylae all feared that the army might advance against them and prepared accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.101.3,these fears were shared by the thracians beyond the strymon to the north who inhabited the plains such as the panaeans the odomanti the droi and the dersaeans all of whom are independent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.101.4,it was even matter of conversation among the hellenes who were enemies of athens whether he might not be invited by his ally to advance also against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.101.5,meanwhile he held chalcidice and bottice and macedonia and was ravaging them all but finding that he was not succeeding in any of the objects of his invasion and that his army was without provisions and was suffering from the severity of the season he listened to the advice of seuthes son of sparadocus his nephew and highest officer and decided to retreat without delay this seuthes had been secretly gained by perdiccas by the promise of his sister in marriage with a rich dowry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.101.6,in accordance with this advice and after a stay of thirty days in all eight of which were spent in chalcidice he retired home as quickly as he could and perdiccas afterwards gave his sister stratonice to seuthes as he had promised such was the history of the expedition of sitalces
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.102.1,in the course of this winter after the dispersion of the peloponnesian fleet the athenians in naupactus under phormio coasted along to astacus and disembarked and marched into the interior of acarnania with four hundred athenian heavy infantry and four hundred messenians after expelling some suspected persons from stratus coronta and other places and restoring cynes son of theolytus to coronta they returned to their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.102.2,deciding that it was impossible in the winter season to march against oeniadae a place which unlike the rest of acarnania had been always hostile to them for the river achelous flowing from mount pindus through dolopia and the country of the agraeans and amphilochians and the plain of acarnania past the town of stratus in the upper part of its course forms lakes where it falls into the sea round oeniadae and thus makes it impracticable for an army in winter by reason of the water
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.102.3,opposite to oeniadae lie most of the islands called echinades so close to the mouths of the achelous that that powerful stream is constantly forming deposits against them and has already joined some of the islands to the continent and seems likely in no long while to do the same with the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.102.4,for the current is strong deep and turbid and the islands are so thick together that they serve to imprison the alluvial deposit and prevent its dispersing lying as they do not in one line but irregularly so as to leave no direct passage for the water into the open sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.102.5,the islands in question are uninhabited and of no great size there is also a story that alcmaeon son of amphiaraus during his wanderings after the murder of his mother was bidden by apollo to inhabit this spot through an oracle which intimated that he would have no release from his terrors until he should find a country to dwell in which had not been seen by the sun or existed as land at the time he slew his mother all else being to him polluted ground
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.102.6,perplexed at this the story goes on to say he at last observed this deposit of the achelous and considered that a place sufficient to support life upon might have been thrown up during the long interval that had elapsed since the death of his mother and the beginning of his wanderings settling therefore in the district round oeniadae he founded a dominion and left the country its name from his son acarnan such is the story we have received concerning alcmaeon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.103.1,the athenians and phormio putting back from acarnania and arriving at naupactus sailed home to athens in the spring taking with them the ships that they had captured and such of the prisoners made in the late actions as were freemen who were exchanged man for man
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.103.2,and so ended this winter and the third year of this war of which thucydides was the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.1.1,the next summer just as the corn was getting ripe the peloponnesians and their allies invaded attica under the command of archidamus son of zeuxidamus king of the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.1.2,and sat down and ravaged the land the athenian horse as usual attacking them wherever it was practicable and preventing the mass of the light troops from advancing from their camp and wasting the parts near the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.1.3,after staying the time for which they had taken provisions the invaders retired and dispersed to their several cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.2.1,immediately after the invasion of the peloponnesians all lesbos except methymna revolted from the athenians the lesbians had wished to revolt even before the war but the lacedaemonians would not receive them and yet now when they did revolt they were compelled to do so sooner than they had intended
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.2.2,while they were waiting until the moles for their harbors and the ships and walls that they had in building should be finished and for the arrival of archers and corn and other things that they were engaged in fetching from the pontus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.2.3,the tenedians with whom they were at enmity and the methymnians and some factious persons in mitylene itself who were proxeni of athens informed the athenians that the mitylenians were forcibly uniting the island under their sovereignty and that the preparations about which they were so active were all concerted with the boeotians their kindred and the lacedaemonians with a view to a revolt and that unless they were immediately prevented athens would lose lesbos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.3.1,however the athenians distressed by the plague and by the war that had recently broken out and was now raging thought it a serious matter to add lesbos with its fleet and untouched resources to the list of their enemies and at first would not believe the charge giving too much weight to their wish that it might not be true but when an embassy which they sent had failed to persuade the mitylenians to give up the union and preparations complained of they became alarmed and resolved to strike the first blow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.3.2,they accordingly suddenly sent off forty ships that had been got ready to sail round peloponnese under the command of cleippides son of deinias and two others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.3.3,word having been brought them of a festival in honor of the malean apollo outside the town which is kept by the whole people of mitylene and at which if haste were made they might hope to take them by surprise if this plan succeeded well and good if not they were to order the mitylenians to deliver up their ships and to pull down their walls and if they did not obey to declare war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.3.4,the ships accordingly set out the ten triremes forming the contingent of the mitylenians present with the fleet according to the terms of the alliance being detained by the athenians and their crews placed in custody
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.3.5,however the mitylenians were informed of the expedition by a man who crossed from athens to euboea and going overland to geraestus sailed from thence by a merchantman which he found on the point of putting to sea and so arrived at mitylene the third day after leaving athens the mitylenians accordingly refrained from going out to the temple at malea and moreover barricaded and kept guard round the halffinished parts of their walls and harbors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.4.1,when the athenians sailed in not long after and saw how things stood the generals delivered their orders and upon the mitylenians refusing to obey commenced hostilities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.4.2,the mitylenians thus compelled to go to war without notice and unprepared at first sailed out with their fleet and made some show of fighting a little in front of the harbor but being driven back by the athenian ships immediately offered to treat with the commanders wishing if possible to get the ships away for the present upon any tolerable terms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.4.3,the athenian commanders accepted their offers being themselves fearful that they might not be able to cope with the whole of lesbos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.4.4,and an armistice having been concluded the mitylenians sent to athens one of the informers already repentant of his conduct and others with him to try to persuade the athenians of the innocence of their intentions and to get the fleet recalled
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.4.5,in the meantime having no great hope of a favorable answer from athens they also sent off a trireme with envoys to lacedaemon unobserved by the athenian fleet which was anchored at malea to the north of the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.4.6,while these envoys reaching lacedaemon after a difficult journey across the open sea were negotiating for succors being sent them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.5.1,the ambassadors from athens returned without having effected anything and hostilities were at once begun by the mitylenians and the rest of lesbos with the exception of the methymnians who came to the aid of the athenians with the imbrians and lemnians and some few of the other allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.5.2,the mitylenians made a sortie with all their forces against the athenian camp and a battle ensued in which they gained some slight advantage but retired notwithstanding not feeling sufficient confidence in themselves to spend the night upon the field after this they kept quiet wishing to wait for the chance of reinforcements arriving from peloponnese before making a second venture being encouraged by the arrival of meleas a laconian and hermaeondas a theban who had been sent off before the insurrection but had been unable to reach lesbos before the athenian expedition and who now stole in in a trireme after the battle and advised them to send another trireme and envoys back with them which the mitylenians accordingly did
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.6.1,meanwhile the athenians greatly encouraged by the inaction of the mitylenians summoned allies to their aid who came in all the quicker from seeing so little vigor displayed by the lesbians and bringing round their ships to a new station to the south of the town fortified two camps one on each side of the city and instituted a blockade of both the harbors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.6.2,the sea was thus closed against the mitylenians who however commanded the whole country with the rest of the lesbians who had now joined them the athenians only holding a limited area round their camps and using malea more as the station for their ships and their market
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.7.1,while the war went on in this way at mitylene the athenians about the same time in this summer also sent thirty ships to peloponnese under asopius son of phormio the acarnanians insisting that the commander sent should be some son or relative of phormio
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.7.2,as the ships coasted along shore they ravaged the seaboard of laconia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.7.3,after which asopius sent most of the fleet home and himself went on with twelve vessels to naupactus and afterwards raising the whole acarnanian population made an expedition against oeniadae the fleet sailing along the achelous while the army laid waste the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.7.4,the inhabitants however showing no signs of submitting he dismissed the land forces and himself sailed to leucas and making a descent upon nericus was cut off during his retreat and most of his troops with him by the people in those parts aided by some coastguards
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.7.5,after which the athenians sailed away recovering their dead from the leucadians under truce
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.8.1,meanwhile the envoys of the mitylenians sent out in the first ship were told by the lacedaemonians to come to olympia in order that the rest of the allies might hear them and decide upon their matter and so they journeyed thither it was the olympiad in which the rhodian dorieus gained his second victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.8.2,and the envoys having been introduced to make their speech after the festival spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.9.1,lacedaemonians and allies the rule established among the hellenes is not unknown to us those who revolt in war and forsake their former confederacy are favorably regarded by those who receive them in so far as they are of use to them but otherwise are thought less well of through being considered traitors to their former friends
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.9.2,nor is this an unfair way of judging where the rebels and the power from whom they secede are at one in policy and sympathy and a match for each other in resources and power and where no reasonable ground exists for the rebellion but with us and the athenians this was not the case
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.9.3,and no one need think the worse of us for revolting from them in danger after having been honored by them in time of peace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.10.1,justice and honesty will be the first topics of our speech especially as we are asking for alliance because we know that there can never be any solid friendship between individuals or union between communities that is worth the name unless the parties be persuaded of each other s honesty and be generally congenial the one to the other since from difference in feeling springs also difference in conduct
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.10.2,between ourselves and the athenians alliance began when you withdrew from the median war and they remained to finish the business
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.10.3,but we did not become allies of the athenians for the subjugation of the hellenes but allies of the hellenes for their liberation from the mede
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.10.4,and as long as the athenians led us fairly we followed them loyally but when we saw them relax their hostility to the mede to try to compass the subjection of the allies then our apprehensions began
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.10.5,unable however to unite and defend themselves on account of the number of confederates that had votes all the allies were enslaved except ourselves and the chians who continued to send our contingents as independent and nominally free
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.10.6,trust in athens as a leader however we could no longer feel judging by the examples already given it being unlikely that she would reduce our fellowconfederates and not do the same by us who were left if ever she had the power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.1,had we all been still independent we could have had more faith in their not attempting any change but the greater number being their subjects while they were treating us as equals they would naturally chafe under this solitary instance of independence as contrasted with the submission of the majority particularly as they daily grew more powerful and we more destitute
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.2,now the only sure basis of an alliance is for each party to be equally afraid of the other he who would like to encroach is then deterred by the reflection that he will not have odds in his favour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.3,again if we were left independent it was only because they thought they saw their way to empire more clearly by specious language and by the paths of policy than by those of force
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.4,not only were we useful as evidence that powers who had votes like themselves would not surely join them in their expeditions against their will without the party attacked being in the wrong but the same system also enabled them to lead the stronger states against the weaker first and so to leave the former to the last stripped of their natural allies and less capable of resistance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.5,but if they had begun with us while all the states still had their resources under their own control and there was a center to rally round the work of subjugation would have been found less easy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.6,besides this our navy gave them some apprehension it was always possible that it might unite with you or with some other power and become dangerous to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.7,the court which we paid to their commons and its leaders for the time being also helped us to maintain our independence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.11.8,however we did not expect to be able to do so much longer if this war had not broken out from the examples that we had had of their conduct to the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.12.1,how then could we put our trust in such friendship or freedom as we had here we accepted each other against our inclination fear made them court us in war and us them in peace sympathy the ordinary basis of confidence had its place supplied by terror fear having more share than friendship in detaining us in the alliance and the first party that should be encouraged by the hope of impunity was certain to break faith with the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.12.2,so that to condemn us for being the first to break off because they delay the blow that we dread instead of ourselves delaying to know for certain whether it will be dealt or not is to take a false view of the case
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.12.3,for if we were equally able with them to meet their plots and imitate their delay we should be their equals and should be under no necessity of being their subjects but the liberty of offence being always theirs that of defence ought clearly to be ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.1,such lacedaemonians and allies are the grounds and the reasons of our revolt clear enough to convince our hearers of the fairness of our conduct and sufficient to alarm ourselves and to make us turn to some means of safety this we wished to do long ago when we sent to you on the subject while the peace yet lasted but were baulked by your refusing to receive us and now upon the boeotians inviting us we at once responded to the call and decided upon a twofold revolt from the hellenes and from the athenians not to aid the latter in harming the former but to join in their liberation and not to allow the athenians in the end to destroy us but to act in time against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.2,our revolt however has taken place prematurely and without preparation a fact which makes it all the more incumbent on you to receive us into alliance and to send us speedy relief in order to show that you support your friends and at the same time do harm to your enemies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.3,you have an opportunity such as you never had before disease and expenditure have wasted the athenians their ships are either cruising round your coasts or engaged in blockading us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.4,and it is not probable that they will have any to spare if you invade them a second time this summer by sea and land but they will either offer no resistance to your vessels or withdraw from both our shores
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.5,nor must it be thought that this is a case of putting yourselves into danger for a country which is not yours lesbos may appear far off but when help is wanted she will be found near enough it is not in attica that the war will be decided as some imagine but in the countries by which attica is supported
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.6,and the athenian revenue is drawn from the allies and will become still larger if they reduce us as not only will no other state revolt but our resources will be added to theirs and we shall be treated worse than those that were enslaved before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.13.7,but if you will frankly support us you will add to your side a state that has a large navy which is your great want you will smooth the way to the overthrow of the athenians by depriving them of their allies who will be greatly encouraged to come over and you will free yourselves from the imputation made against you of not supporting insurrection in short only show yourselves as liberators and you may count upon having the advantage in the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.14.1,respect therefore the hopes placed in you by the hellenes and that olympian zeus in whose temple we stand as very suppliants become the allies and defenders of the mitylenians and do not sacrifice us who put our lives upon the hazard in a cause in which general good will result to all from our success and still more general harm if we fail through your refusing to help us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.14.2,but be the men that the hellenes think you and our fears desire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.15.1,such were the words of the mitylenians after hearing them out the lacedaemonians and confederates granted what they urged and took the lesbians into alliance and deciding in favour of the invasion of attica told the allies present to march as quickly as possible to the isthmus with twothirds of their forces and arriving there first themselves got ready hauling machines to carry their ships across from corinth to the sea on the side of athens in order to make their attack by sea and land at once
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.15.2,however the zeal which they displayed was not imitated by the rest of the confederates who came in but slowly being engaged in harvesting their corn and sick of making expeditions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.16.1,meanwhile the athenians aware that the preparations of the enemy were due to his conviction of their weakness and wishing to show him that he was mistaken and that they were able without moving the lesbian fleet to repel with ease that with which they were menaced from peloponnese manned a hundred ships by embarking the citizens of athens except the knights and pentecosiomedimni and the resident aliens and putting out to the isthmus displayed their power and made descents upon peloponnese wherever they pleased
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.16.2,a disappointment so signal made the lacedaemonians think that the lesbians had not spoken the truth and embarrassed by the nonappearance of the confederates coupled with the news that the thirty ships round peloponnese were ravaging the lands near sparta they went back home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.16.3,afterwards however they got ready a fleet to send to lesbos and ordering a total of forty ships from the different cities in the league appointed alcidas to command the expedition in his capacity of high admiral
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.16.4,meanwhile the athenians in the hundred ships upon seeing the lacedaemonians go home went home likewise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.17.1,if at the time that this fleet was at sea athens had almost the largest number of firstrate ships in commission that she ever possessed at any one moment she had as many or even more when the war began
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.17.2,at that time one hundred guarded attica euboea and salamis a hundred more were cruising round peloponnese besides those employed at potidaea and in other places making a grand total of two hundred and fifty vessels employed on active service in a single summer
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.17.3,it was this with potidaea that most exhausted her revenues
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.17.4,potidaea being blockaded by a force of heavy infantry each drawing two drachmae a day one for himself and another for his servant which amounted to three thousand at first and was kept at this number down to the end of the siege besides sixteen hundred with phormio who went away before it was over and the ships being all paid at the same rate in this way her money was wasted at first and this was the largest number of ships ever manned by her
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.18.1,about the same time that the lacedaemonians were at the isthmus the mitylenians marched by land with their mercenaries against methymna which they thought to gain by treachery after assaulting the town and not meeting with the success that they anticipated they withdrew to antissa pyrrha and eresus and taking measures for the better security of these towns and strengthening their walls hastily returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.18.2,after their departure the methymnians marched against antissa but were defeated in a sortie by the antissians and their mercenaries and retreated in haste after losing many of their number
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.18.3,word of this reaching athens and the athenians learning that the mitylenians were masters of the country and their own soldiers unable to hold them in check they sent out about the beginning of autumn paches son of epicurus to take the command and a thousand athenian heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.18.4,who worked their own passage and arriving at mitylene built a single wall all round it forts being erected at some of the strongest points
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.18.5,mitylene was thus blockaded strictly on both sides by land and by sea and winter now drew near
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.19.1,the athenians needing money for the siege although they had for the first time raised a contribution of two hundred talents from their own citizens now sent out twelve ships to levy subsidies from their allies with lysicles and four others in command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.19.2,after cruising to different places and laying them under contribution lysicles went up the country from myus in caria across the plain of the meander as far as the hill of sandius and being attacked by the carians and the people of anaia was slain with many of his soldiers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.20.1,the same winter the plataeans who were still being besieged by the peloponnesians and boeotians distressed by the failure of their provisions and seeing no hope of relief from athens nor any other means of safety formed a scheme with the athenians besieged with them for escaping if possible by forcing their way over the enemy s walls the attempt having been suggested by theaenetus son of tolmides a soothsayer and eupompides son of daimachus one of their generals at first all were to join
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.20.2,afterwards half hung back thinking the risk great about two hundred and twenty however voluntarily persevered in the attempt which was carried out in the following way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.20.3,ladders were made to match the height of the enemy s wall which they measured by the layers of bricks the side turned towards them not being thoroughly whitewashed these were counted by many persons at once and though some might miss the right calculation most would hit upon it particularly as they counted over and over again and were no great way from the wall but could see it easily enough for their purpose
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.20.4,the length required for the ladders was thus obtained being calculated from the breadth of the brick
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.21.1,now the wall of the peloponnesians was constructed as follows it consisted of two lines drawn round the place one against the plataeans the other against any attack on the outside from athens about sixteen feet apart
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.21.2,the intermediate space of sixteen feet was occupied by huts portioned out among the soldiers on guard and built in one block so as to give the appearance of a single thick wall with battlements on either side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.21.3,at intervals of every ten battlements were towers of considerable size and the same breadth as the wall reaching right across from its inner to its outer face with no means of passing except through the middle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.21.4,accordingly on stormy and wet nights the battlements were deserted and guard kept from the towers which were not far apart and roofed in above such being the structure of the wall by which the plataeans were blockaded
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.1,when their preparations were completed they waited for a stormy night of wind and rain and without any moon and then set out guided by the authors of the enterprise crossing first the ditch that ran round the town they next gained the wall of the enemy unperceived by the sentinels who did not see them in the darkness or hear them as the wind drowned with its roar the noise of their approach
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.2,besides which they kept a good way off from each other that they might not be betrayed by the clash of their weapons they were also lightly equipped and had only the left foot shod to preserve them from slipping in the mire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.3,they came up to the battlements at one of the intermediate spaces where they knew them to be unguarded those who carried the ladders went first and planted them next twelve lightarmed soldiers with only a dagger and a breastplate mounted led by ammias son of coroebus who was the first on the wall his followers getting up after him and going six to each of the towers after these came another party of light troops armed with spears whose shields that they might advance the easier were carried by men behind who were to hand them to them when they found themselves in presence of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.4,after a good many had mounted they were discovered by the sentinels in the towers by the noise made by a tile which was knocked down by one of the plataeans as he was laying hold of the battlements
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.5,the alarm was instantly given and the troops rushed to the wall not knowing the nature of the danger owing to the dark night and stormy weather the plataeans in the town having also chosen that moment to make a sortie against the wall of the peloponnesians upon the side opposite to that on which their men were getting over in order to divert the attention of the besiegers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.6,accordingly they remained distracted at their several posts without any venturing to stir to give help from his own station and at a loss to guess what was going on
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.7,meanwhile the three hundred set aside for service on emergencies went outside the wall in the direction of the alarm firesignals of an attack were also raised towards thebes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.22.8,but the plataeans in the town at once displayed a number of others prepared beforehand for this very purpose in order to render the enemy s signals unintelligible and to prevent his friends getting a true idea of what was passing and coming to his aid before their comrades who had gone out should have made good their escape and be in safety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.23.1,meanwhile the first of the scalingparty that had got up after carrying both the towers and putting the sentinels to the sword posted themselves inside to prevent any one coming through against them and rearing ladders from the wall sent several men up on the towers and from their summit and base kept in check all of the enemy that came up with their missiles while their main body planted a number of ladders against the wall and knocking down the battlements passed over between the towers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.23.2,each as soon as he had got over taking up his station at the edge of the ditch and plying from thence with arrows and darts any who came along the wall to stop the passage of his comrades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.23.3,when all were over the party on the towers came down the last of them not without difficulty and proceeded to the ditch just as the three hundred came up carrying torches
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.23.4,the plataeans standing on the edge of the ditch in the dark had a good view of their opponents and discharged their arrows and darts upon the unarmed parts of their bodies while they themselves could not be so well seen in the obscurity for the torches and thus even the last of them got over the ditch though not without effort and difficulty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.23.5,as ice had formed in it not strong enough to walk upon but of that watery kind which generally comes with a wind more east than north and the snow which this wind had caused to fall during the night had made the water in the ditch rise so that they could scarcely breast it as they crossed however it was mainly the violence of the storm that enabled them to effect their escape at all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.24.1,starting from the ditch the plataeans went all together along the road leading to thebes keeping the chapel of the hero androcrates upon their right considering that the last road which the peloponnesians would suspect them of having taken would be that towards their enemies country indeed they could see them pursuing with torches upon the athens road towards cithaeron and druoskephalai or oakheads
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.24.2,after going for rather more than half a mile upon the road to thebes the plataeans turned off and took that leading to the mountain to erythrae and hysiae and reaching the hills made good their escape to athens two hundred and twelve men in all some of their number having turned back into the town before getting over the wall and one archer having been taken prisoner at the outer ditch
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.24.3,meanwhile the peloponnesians gave up the pursuit and returned to their posts and the plataeans in the town knowing nothing of what had passed and informed by those who had turned back that not a man had escaped sent out a herald as soon as it was day to make a truce for the recovery of the dead bodies and then learning the truth desisted in this way the plataean party got over and were saved
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.25.1,towards the close of the same winter salaethus a lacedaemonian was sent out in a trireme from lacedaemon to mitylene going by sea to pyrrha and from thence overland he passed along the bed of a torrent where the line of circumvallation was passable and thus entering unperceived into mitylene told the magistrates that attica would certainly be invaded and the forty ships destined to relieve them arrive and that he had been sent on to announce this and to superintend matters generally
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.25.2,the mitylenians upon this took courage and laid aside the idea of treating with the athenians and now this winter ended and with it ended the fourth year of the war of which thucydides was the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.26.1,the next summer the peloponnesians sent off the fortytwo ships for mitylene under alcidas their high admiral and themselves and their allies invaded attica their object being to distract the athenians by a double movement and thus to make it less easy for them to act against the fleet sailing to mitylene
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.26.2,the commander in this invasion was cleomenes in the place of king pausanias son of pleistoanax his nephew who was still a minor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.26.3,not content with laying waste whatever had shot up in the parts which they had before devastated the invaders now extended their ravages to lands passed over in their previous incursions so that this invasion was more severely felt by the athenians than any except the second
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.26.4,the enemy staying on and on until they had overrun most of the country in the expectation of hearing from lesbos of something having been achieved by their fleet which they thought must now have got over however as they did not obtain any of the results expected and their provisions began to run short they retreated and dispersed to their different cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.27.1,in the meantime the mitylenians finding their provisions failing while the fleet from peloponnese was loitering on the way instead of appearing at mitylene were compelled to come to terms with the athenians in the following manner
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.27.2,salaethus having himself ceased to expect the fleet to arrive now armed the commons with heavy armour which they had not before possessed with the intention of making a sortie against the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.27.3,the commons however no sooner found themselves possessed of arms than they refused any longer to obey their officers and forming in knots together told the authorities to bring out in public the provisions and divide them amongst them all or they would themselves come to terms with the athenians and deliver up the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.28.1,the government aware of their inability to prevent this and of the danger they would be in if left out of the capitulation publicly agreed with paches and the army to surrender mitylene at discretion and to admit the troops into the town upon the understanding that the mitylenians should be allowed to send an embassy to athens to plead their cause and that paches should not imprison make slaves of or put to death any of the citizens until its return
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.28.2,such were the terms of the capitulation in spite of which the chief authors of the negotiation with lacedaemon were so completely overcome by terror when the army entered that they went and seated themselves by the altars from which they were raised up by paches under promise that he would do them no wrong and lodged by him in tenedos until he should learn the pleasure of the athenians concerning them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.28.3,paches also sent some triremes and seized antissa and took such other military measures as he thought advisable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.29.1,meanwhile the peloponnesians in the forty ships who ought to have made all haste to relieve mitylene lost time in coming round peloponnese itself and proceeding leisurely on the remainder of the voyage made delos without having been seen by the athenians at athens and from thence arriving at icarus and myconus there first heard of the fall of mitylene
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.29.2,wishing to know the truth they put into embatum in the erythraeid about seven days after the capture of the town here they learned the truth and began to consider what they were to do and teutiaplus an elean addressed them as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.30.1,alcidas and peloponnesians who share with me the command of this armament my advice is to sail just as we are to mitylene before we have been heard of
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.30.2,we may expect to find the athenians as much on their guard as men generally are who have just taken a city this will certainly be so by sea where they have no idea of any enemy attacking them and where our strength as it happens mainly lies while even their land forces are probably scattered about the houses in the carelessness of victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.30.3,if therefore we were to fall upon them suddenly and in the night i have hopes with the help of the wellwishers that we may have left inside the town that we shall become masters of the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.30.4,let us not shrink from the risk but let us remember that this is just the occasion for one of the baseless panics common in war and that to be able to guard against these in one s own case and to detect the moment when an attack will find an enemy at this disadvantage is what makes a successful general
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.31.1,these words of teutiaplus failing to move alcidas some of the ionian exiles and the lesbians with the expedition began to urge him since this seemed too dangerous to seize one of the ionian cities or the aeolic town of cyme to use as a base for effecting the revolt of ionia this was by no means a hopeless enterprise as their coming was welcome everywhere their object would be by this move to deprive athens of her chief source of revenue and at the same time to saddle her with expense if she chose to blockade them and they would probably induce pissuthnes to join them in the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.31.2,however alcidas gave this proposal as bad a reception as the other being eager since he had come too late for mitylene to find himself back in peloponnese as soon as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.32.1,accordingly he put out from embatum and proceeded along shore and touching at the teian town myonnesus there butchered most of the prisoners that he had taken on his passage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.32.2,upon his coming to anchor at ephesus envoys came to him from the samians at anaia and told him that he was not going the right way to free hellas in massacring men who had never raised a hand against him and who were not enemies of his but allies of athens against their will and that if he did not stop he would turn many more friends into enemies than enemies into friends
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.32.3,alcidas agreed to this and let go all the chians still in his hands and some of the others that he had taken the inhabitants instead of flying at the sight of his vessels rather coming up to them taking them for athenian having no sort of expectation that while the athenians commanded the sea peloponnesian ships would venture over to ionia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.33.1,from ephesus alcidas set sail in haste and fled he had been seen by the salaminian and paralian galleys which happened to be sailing from athens while still at anchor off clarus and fearing pursuit he now made across the open sea fully determined to touch nowhere if he could help it until he got to peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.33.2,meanwhile news of him had come in to paches from the erythraeid and indeed from all quarters as ionia was unfortified great fears were felt that the peloponnesians coasting along shore even if they did not intend to stay might make descents in passing and plunder the towns and now the paralian and salaminian having seen him at clarus themselves brought intelligence of the fact
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.33.3,paches accordingly gave hot chase and continued the pursuit as far as the isle of patmos and then finding that alcidas had got on too far to be overtaken came back again meanwhile he thought it fortunate that as he had not fallen in with them out at sea he had not overtaken them anywhere where they would have been forced to encamp and so give him the trouble of blockading them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.34.1,on his return along shore he touched among other places at notium the port of colophon where the colophonians had settled after the capture of the upper town by itamenes and the barbarians who had been called in by certain individuals in a party quarrel the capture of the town took place about the time of the second peloponnesian invasion of attica
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.34.2,however the refugees after settling at notium again split up into factions one of which called in arcadian and barbarian mercenaries from pissuthnes and entrenching these in a quarter apart formed a new community with the median party of the colophonians who joined them from the upper town their opponents had retired into exile and now called in paches
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.34.3,who invited hippias the commander of the arcadians in the fortified quarter to a parley upon condition that if they could not agree he was to be put back safe and sound in the fortification however upon his coming out to him he put him into custody though not in chains and attacked suddenly and took by surprise the fortification and putting the arcadians and the barbarians found in it to the sword afterwards took hippias into it as he had promised and as soon as he was inside seized him and shot him down
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.34.4,paches then gave up notium to the colophonians not of the median party and settlers were afterwards sent out from athens and the place colonized according to athenian laws after collecting all the colophonians found in any of the cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.35.1,arrived at mitylene paches reduced pyrrha and eresus and finding the lacedaemonian salaethus in hiding in the town sent him off to athens together with the mitylenians that he had placed in tenedos and any other persons that he thought concerned in the revolt

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.36.1,upon the arrival of the prisoners with salaethus the athenians at once put the latter to death although he offered among other things to procure the withdrawal of the peloponnesians from plataea which was still under siege
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.36.2,and after deliberating as to what they should do with the former in the fury of the moment determined to put to death not only the prisoners at athens but the whole adult male population of mitylene and to make slaves of the women and children it was remarked that mitylene had revolted without being like the rest subjected to the empire and what above all swelled the wrath of the athenians was the fact of the peloponnesian fleet having ventured over to ionia to her support a fact which was held to argue a longmeditated rebellion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.36.3,they accordingly sent a trireme to communicate the decree to paches commanding him to lose no time in despatching the mitylenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.36.4,the morrow brought repentance with it and reflection on the horrid cruelty of a decree which condemned a whole city to the fate merited only by the guilty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.36.5,this was no sooner perceived by the mitylenian ambassadors at athens and their athenian supporters than they moved the authorities to put the question again to the vote which they the more easily consented to do as they themselves plainly saw that most of the citizens wished some one to give them an opportunity for reconsidering the matter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.36.6,an assembly was therefore at once called and after much expression of opinion upon both sides cleon son of cleaenetus the same who had carried the former motion of putting the mitylenians to death the most violent man at athens and at that time by far the most powerful with the commons came forward again and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.37.1,i have often before now been convinced that a democracy is incapable of empire and never more so than by your present change of mind in the matter of mitylene
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.37.2,fears or plots being unknown to you in your daily relations with each other you feel just the same with regard to your allies and never reflect that the mistakes into which you may be led by listening to their appeals or by giving way to your own compassion are full of danger to yourselves and bring you no thanks for your weakness from your allies entirely forgetting that your empire is a despotism and your subjects disaffected conspirators whose obedience is insured not by your suicidal concessions but by the superiority given you by your own strength and not their loyalty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.37.3,the most alarming feature in the case is the constant change of measures with which we appear to be threatened and our seeming ignorance of the fact that bad laws which are never changed are better for a city than good ones that have no authority that unlearned loyalty is more serviceable than quickwitted insubordination and that ordinary men usually manage public affairs better than their more gifted fellows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.37.4,the latter are always wanting to appear wiser than the laws and to overrule every proposition brought forward thinking that they cannot show their wit in more important matters and by such behavior too often ruin their country while those who mistrust their own cleverness are content to be less learned than the laws and less able to pick holes in the speech of a good speaker and being fair judges rather than rival athletes generally conduct affairs successfully
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.37.5,these we ought to imitate instead of being led on by cleverness and intellectual rivalry to advise your people against our real opinions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.1,for myself i adhere to my former opinion and wonder at those who have proposed to reopen the case of the mitylenians and who are thus causing a delay which is all in favour of the guilty by making the sufferer proceed against the offender with the edge of his anger blunted although where vengeance follows most closely upon the wrong it best equals it and most amply requites it i wonder also who will be the man who will maintain the contrary and will pretend to show that the crimes of the mitylenians are of service to us and our misfortunes injurious to the allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.2,such a man must plainly either have such confidence in his rhetoric as to adventure to prove that what has been once for all decided is still undetermined or be bribed to try to delude us by elaborate sophisms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.3,in such contests the state gives the rewards to others and takes the dangers for herself
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.4,the persons to blame are you who are so foolish as to institute these contests who go to see an oration as you would to see a sight take your facts on hearsay judge of the practicability of a project by the wit of its advocates and trust for the truth as to past events not to the fact which you saw more than to the clever strictures which you heard
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.5,the easy victims of newfangled arguments unwilling to follow received conclusions slaves to every new paradox despisers of the commonplace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.6,the first wish of every man being that he could speak himself the next to rival those who can speak by seeming to be quite up with their ideas by applauding every hit almost before it is made and by being as quick in catching an argument as you are slow in foreseeing its consequences
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.38.7,asking if i may so say for something different from the conditions under which we live and yet comprehending inadequately those very conditions very slaves to the pleasure of the ear and more like the audience of a rhetorician than the council of a city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.1,in order to keep you from this i proceed to show that no one state has ever injured you as much as mitylene
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.2,i can make allowance for those who revolt because they cannot bear our empire or who have been forced to do so by the enemy but for those who possessed an island with fortifications who could fear our enemies only by sea and there had their own force of triremes to protect them who were independent and held in the highest honor by you to act as these have done this is not revolt revolt implies oppression it is deliberate and wanton aggression an attempt to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies a worse offence than a war undertaken on their own account in the acquisition of power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.3,the fate of those of their neighbors who had already rebelled and had been subdued was no lesson to them their own prosperity could not dissuade them from affronting danger but blindly confident in the future and full of hopes beyond their power though not beyond their ambition they declared war and made their decision to prefer might to right their attack being determined not by provocation but by the moment which seemed propitious
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.4,the truth is that great good fortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make a people insolent in most cases it is safer for mankind to have success in reason than out of reason and it is easier for them one may say to stave off adversity than to preserve prosperity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.5,our mistake has been to distinguish the mitylenians as we have done had they been long ago treated like the rest they never would have so far forgotten themselves human nature being as surely made arrogant by consideration as it is awed by firmness
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.6,let them now therefore be punished as their crime requires and do not while you condemn the aristocracy absolve the people this is certain that all attacked you without distinction although they might have come over to us and been now again in possession of their city but no they thought it safer to throw in their lot with the aristocracy and so joined their rebellion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.7,consider therefore if you subject to the same punishment the ally who is forced to rebel by the enemy and him who does so by his own free choice which of them think you is there that will not rebel upon the slightest pretext when the reward of success is freedom and the penalty of failure nothing so very terrible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.39.8,we meanwhile shall have to risk our money and our lives against one state after another and if successful shall receive a ruined town from which we can no longer draw the revenue upon which our strength depends while if unsuccessful we shall have an enemy the more upon our hands and shall spend the time that might be employed in combating our existing foes in warring with our own allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.1,no hope therefore that rhetoric may instil or money purchase of the mercy due to human infirmity must be held out to the mitylenians their offence was not involuntary but of malice and deliberate and mercy is only for unwilling offenders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.2,i therefore now as before persist against your reversing your first decision or giving way to the three failings most fatal to empire pity sentiment and indulgence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.3,compassion is due to those who can reciprocate the feeling not to those who will never pity us in return but are our natural and necessary foes the orators who charm us with sentiment may find other less important arenas for their talents in the place of one where the city pays a heavy penalty for a momentary pleasure themselves receiving fine acknowledgments for their fine phrases while indulgence should be shown towards those who will be our friends in future instead of towards men who will remain just what they were and as much our enemies as before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.4,to sum up shortly i say that if you follow my advice you will do what is just towards the mitylenians and at the same time expedient while by a different decision you will not oblige them so much as pass sentence upon yourselves for if they were right in rebelling you must be wrong in ruling however if right or wrong you determine to rule you must carry out your principle and punish the mitylenians as your interest requires or else you must give up your empire and cultivate honesty without danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.5,make up your minds therefore to give them like for like and do not let the victims who escaped the plot be more insensible than the conspirators who hatched it but reflect what they would have done if victorious over you especially as they were the aggressors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.6,it is they who wrong their neighbor without a cause that pursue their victim to the death on account of the danger which they foresee in letting their enemy survive since the object of a wanton wrong is more dangerous if he escape than an enemy who has not this to complain of
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.40.7,do not therefore be traitors to yourselves but recall as nearly as possible the moment of suffering and the supreme importance which you then attached to their reduction and now pay them back in their turn without yielding to present weakness or forgetting the peril that once hung over you punish them as they deserve and teach your other allies by a striking example that the penalty of rebellion is death let them once understand this and you will not have so often to neglect your enemies while you are fighting with your own confederates
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.41.1,such were the words of cleon after him diodotus son of eucrates who had also in the previous assembly spoken most strongly against putting the mitylenians to death came forward and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.42.1,i do not blame the persons who have reopened the case of the mitylenians nor do i approve the protests which we have heard against important questions being frequently debated i think the two things most opposed to good counsel are haste and passion haste usually goes hand in hand with folly passion with coarseness and narrowness of mind
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.42.2,as for the argument that speech ought not to be the exponent of action the man who uses it must be either senseless or interested senseless if he believes it possible to treat of the uncertain future through any other medium interested if wishing to carry a disgraceful measure and doubting his ability to speak well in a bad cause he thinks to frighten opponents and hearers by wellaimed calumny
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.42.3,what is still more intolerable is to accuse a speaker of making a display in order to be paid for it if ignorance only were imputed an unsuccessful speaker might retire with a reputation for honesty if not for wisdom while the charge of dishonesty makes him suspected if successful and thought if defeated not only a fool but a rogue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.42.4,the city is no gainer by such a system since fear deprives it of its advisers although in truth if our speakers are to make such assertions it would be better for the country if they could not speak at all as we should then make fewer blunders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.42.5,the good citizen ought to triumph not by frightening his opponents but by beating them fairly in argument and a wise city without overdistinguishing its best advisers will nevertheless not deprive them of their due and far from punishing an unlucky counsellor will not even regard him as disgraced
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.42.6,in this way successful orators would be least tempted to sacrifice their convictions for popularity in the hope of still higher honors and unsuccessful speakers to resort to the same popular arts in order to win over the multitude
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.43.1,this is not our way and besides the moment that a man is suspected of giving advice however good from corrupt motives we feel such a grudge against him for the gain which after all we are not certain he will receive that we deprive the city of its certain benefit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.43.2,plain good advice has thus come to be no less suspected than bad and the advocate of the most monstrous measures is not more obliged to use deceit to gain the people than the best counsellor is to lie in order to be believed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.43.3,the city and the city only owing to these refinements can never be served openly and without disguise he who does serve it openly being always suspected of serving himself in some secret way in return
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.43.4,still considering the magnitude of the interests involved and the position of affairs we orators must make it our business to look a little further than you who judge offhand especially as we your advisers are responsible while you our audience are not so
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.43.5,for if those who gave the advice and those who took it suffered equally you would judge more calmly as it is you visit the disasters into which the whim of the moment may have led you upon the single person of your adviser not upon yourselves his numerous companions in error
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.44.1,however i have not come forward either to oppose or to accuse in the matter of mitylene indeed the question before us as sensible men is not their guilt but our interests
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.44.2,though i prove them ever so guilty i shall not therefore advise their death unless it be expedient nor though they should have claims to indulgence shall i recommend it unless it be clearly for the good of the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.44.3,i consider that we are deliberating for the future more than for the present and where cleon is so positive as to the useful deterrent effects that will follow from making rebellion capital i who consider the interests of the future quite as much as he as positively maintain the contrary
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.44.4,and i require you not to reject my useful considerations for his specious ones his speech may have the attraction of seeming the more just in your present temper against mitylene but we are not in a court of justice but in a political assembly and the question is not justice but how to make the mitylenians useful to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.1,now of course communities have enacted the penalty of death for many offences far lighter than this still hope leads men to venture and no one ever yet put himself in peril without the inward conviction that he would succeed in his design
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.2,again was there ever city rebelling that did not believe that it possessed either in itself or in its alliances resources adequate to the enterprise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.3,all states and individuals are alike prone to err and there is no law that will prevent them or why should men have exhausted the list of punishments in search of enactments to protect them from evildoers it is probable that in early times the penalties for the greatest offences were less severe and that as these were disregarded the penalty of death has been by degrees in most cases arrived at which is itself disregarded in like manner
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.4,either then some means of terror more terrible than this must be discovered or it must be owned that this restraint is useless and that as long as poverty gives men the courage of necessity or plenty fills them with the ambition which belongs to insolence and pride and the other conditions of life remain each under the thraldom of some fatal and master passion so long will the impulse never be wanting to drive men into danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.5,hope also and cupidity the one leading and the other following the one conceiving the attempt the other suggesting the facility of succeeding cause the widest ruin and although invisible agents are far stronger than the dangers that are seen
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.6,fortune too powerfully helps the delusion and by the unexpected aid that she sometimes lends tempts men to venture with inferior means and this is especially the case with communities because the stakes played for are the highest freedom or empire and when all are acting together each man irrationally magnifies his own capacity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.45.7,in fine it is impossible to prevent and only great simplicity can hope to prevent human nature doing what it has once set its mind upon by force of law or by any other deterrent force whatsoever
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.46.1,we must not therefore commit ourselves to a false policy through a belief in the efficacy of the punishment of death or exclude rebels from the hope of repentance and an early atonement of their error
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.46.2,consider a moment at present if a city that has already revolted perceive that it cannot succeed it will come to terms while it is still able to refund expenses and pay tribute afterwards in the other case what city think you would not prepare better than is now done and hold out to the last against its besiegers if it is all one whether it surrender late or soon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.46.3,and how can it be otherwise than hurtful to us to be put to the expense of a siege because surrender is out of the question and if we take the city to receive a ruined town from which we can no longer draw the revenue which forms our real strength against the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.46.4,we must not therefore sit as strict judges of the offenders to our own prejudice but rather see how by moderate chastisements we may be enabled to benefit in future by the revenueproducing powers of our dependencies and we must make up our minds to look for our protection not to legal terrors but to careful administration
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.46.5,at present we do exactly the opposite when a free community held in subjection by force rises as is only natural and asserts its independence it is no sooner reduced than we fancy ourselves obliged to punish it severely
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.46.6,although the right course with freemen is not to chastise them rigorously when they do rise but rigorously to watch them before they rise and to prevent their ever entertaining the idea and the insurrection suppressed to make as few responsible for it as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.47.1,only consider what a blunder you would commit in doing as cleon recommends
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.47.2,as things are at present in all the cities the people is your friend and either does not revolt with the oligarchy or if forced to do so becomes at once the enemy of the insurgents so that in the war with the hostile city you have the masses on your side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.47.3,but if you butcher the people of mitylene who had nothing to do with the revolt and who as soon as they got arms of their own motion surrendered the town first you will commit the crime of killing your benefactors and next you will play directly into the hands of the higher classes who when they induce their cities to rise will immediately have the people on their side through your having announced in advance the same punishment for those who are guilty and for those who are not
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.47.4,on the contrary even if they were guilty you ought to seem not to notice it in order to avoid alienating the only class still friendly to us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.47.5,in short i consider it far more useful for the preservation of our empire voluntarily to put up with injustice than to put to death however justly those whom it is our interest to keep alive as for cleon s idea that in punishment the claims of justice and expediency can both be satisfied facts do not confirm the possibility of such a combination
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.48.1,confess therefore that this is the wisest course and without conceding too much either to pity or to indulgence by neither of which motives do i any more than cleon wish you to be influenced upon the plain merits of the case before you be persuaded by me to try calmly those of the mitylenians whom paches sent off as guilty and to leave the rest undisturbed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.48.2,this is at once best for the future and most terrible to your enemies at the present moment inasmuch as good policy against an adversary is superior to the blind attacks of brute force
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.49.1,such were the words of diodotus the two opinions thus expressed were the ones that most directly contradicted each other and the athenians notwithstanding their change of feeling now proceeded to a division in which the show of hands was almost equal although the motion of diodotus carried the day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.49.2,another trireme was at once sent off in haste for fear that the first might reach lesbos in the interval and the city be found destroyed the first ship having about a day and a night s start
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.49.3,wine and barleycakes were provided for the vessel by the mitylenian ambassadors and great promises made if they arrived in time which caused the men to use such diligence upon the voyage that they took their meals of barleycakes kneaded with oil and wine as they rowed and only slept by turns while the others were at the oar
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.49.4,luckily they met with no contrary wind and the first ship making no haste upon so horrid an errand while the second pressed on in the manner described the first arrived so little before them that paches had only just had time to read the decree and to prepare to execute the sentence when the second put into port and prevented the massacre the danger of mitylene had indeed been great
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.50.1,the other party whom paches had sent off as the prime movers in the rebellion were upon cleon s motion put to death by the athenians the number being rather more than a thousand the athenians also demolished the walls of the mitylenians and took possession of their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.50.2,afterwards tribute was not imposed upon the lesbians but all their land except that of the methymnians was divided into three thousand allotments three hundred of which were reserved as sacred for the gods and the rest assigned by lot to athenian shareholders who were sent out to the island with these the lesbians agreed to pay a rent of two minae a year for each allotment and cultivated the land themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.50.3,the athenians also took possession of the towns on the continent belonging to the mitylenians which thus became for the future subject to athens such were the events that took place at lesbos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.51.1,during the same summer after the reduction of lesbos the athenians under nicias son of niceratus made an expedition against the island of minos which lies off megara and was used as a fortified post by the megarians who had built a tower upon it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.51.2,nicias wished to enable the athenians to maintain their blockade from this nearer station instead of from budorum and salamis to stop the peloponnesian triremes and privateers sailing out unobserved from the island as they had been in the habit of doing and at the same time prevent anything from coming into megara
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.51.3,accordingly after taking two towers projecting on the side of nisaea by engines from the sea and clearing the entrance into the channel between the island and the shore he next proceeded to cut off all communication by building a wall on the mainland at the point where a bridge across a morass enabled succors to be thrown into the island which was not far off from the continent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.51.4,a few days sufficing to accomplish this he afterwards raised some works in the island also and leaving a garrison there departed with his forces
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.52.1,about the same time in this summer the plataean being now without provisions and unable to support the siege surrendered to the peloponnesians in the following manner
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.52.2,an assault had been made upon the wall which the plataeans were unable to repel the lacedaemonian commander perceiving their weakness wished to avoid taking the place by storm his instructions from lacedaemon having been so conceived in order that if at any future time peace should be made with athens and they should agree each to restore the places that they had taken in the war plataea might be held to have come over voluntarily and not be included in the list he accordingly sent a herald to them to ask if they were willing voluntarily to surrender the town to the lacedaemonians and accept them as their judges upon the understanding that the guilty should be punished but no one without form of law
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.52.3,the plataeans were now in the last state of weakness and the herald had no sooner delivered his message than they surrendered the town the peloponnesians fed them for some days until the judges from lacedaemon who were five in number arrived
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.52.4,upon their arrival no charge was preferred they simply called up the plataeans and asked them whether they had done the lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war then raging
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.52.5,the plataeans asked leave to speak at greater length and deputed two of their number to represent them astymachus son of asopolaus and lacon son of aeimnestus proxenus of the lacedaemonians who came forward and spoke as follows

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.53.2,as matters stand we are afraid that we have been doubly deceived we have good reason to suspect not only that the issue to be tried is the most terrible of all but that you will not prove impartial if we may argue from the fact that no accusation was first brought forward for us to answer but we had ourselves to ask leave to speak and from the question being put so shortly that a true answer to it tells against us while a false one can be contradicted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.53.3,in this dilemma our safest and indeed our only course seems to be to say something at all risks placed as we are we could scarcely be silent without being tormented by the damning thought that speaking might have saved us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.53.4,another difficulty that we have to encounter is the difficulty of convincing you were we unknown to each other we might profit by bringing forward new matter with which you were unacquainted as it is we can tell you nothing that you do not know already and we fear not that you have condemned us in your own minds of having failed in our duty towards you and make this our crime but that to please a third party we have to submit to a trial the result of which is already decided
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.54.1,nevertheless we will place before you what we can justly urge not only on the question of the quarrel which the thebans have against us but also as addressing you and the rest of the hellenes and we will remind you of our good services and endeavor to prevail with you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.54.2,to your short question whether we have done the lacedaemonians and allies any service in this war we say if you ask us as enemies that to refrain from serving you was not to do you injury if as friends that you are more in fault for having marched against us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.54.3,during the peace and against the mede we acted well we have not now been the first to break the peace and we were the only boeotians who then joined in defending against the mede the liberty of hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.54.4,although an inland people we were present at the action at artemisium in the battle that took place in our territory we fought by the side of yourselves and pausanias and in all the other hellenic exploits of the time we took a part quite out of proportion to our strength
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.54.5,besides you as lacedaemonians ought not to forget that at the time of the great panic at sparta after the earthquake caused by the secession of the helots to ithome we sent the third part of our citizens to assist you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.55.1,on these great and historical occasions such was the part that we chose although afterwards we became your enemies for this you were to blame when we asked for your alliance against our theban oppressors you rejected our petition and told us to go to the athenians who were our neighbors as you lived too far off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.55.2,in the war we never have done to you and never should have done to you anything unreasonable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.55.3,if we refused to desert the athenians when you asked us we did no wrong they had helped us against the thebans when you drew back and we could no longer give them up with honor especially as we had obtained their alliance and had been admitted to their citizenship at our own request and after receiving benefits at their hands but it was plainly our duty loyally to obey their orders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.55.4,besides the faults that either of you may commit in your supremacy must be laid not upon the followers but on the chiefs that lead them astray
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.1,with regard to the thebans they have wronged us repeatedly and their last aggression which has been the means of bringing us into our present position is within your own knowledge
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.2,in seizing our city in time of peace and what is more at a holy time in the month they justly encountered our vengeance in accordance with the universal law which sanctions resistance to an invader and it cannot now be right that we should suffer on their account
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.3,by taking your own immediate interest and their animosity as the test of justice you will prove yourselves to be rather waiters on expediency than judges of right
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.4,although if they seem useful to you now we and the rest of the hellenes gave you much more valuable help at a time of greater need now you are the assailants and others fear you but at the crisis to which we allude when the barbarian threatened all with slavery the thebans were on his side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.5,it is just therefore to put our patriotism then against our error now if error there has been and you will find the merit outweighing the fault and displayed at a juncture when there were few hellenes who would set their valor against the strength of xerxes and when greater praise was theirs who preferred the dangerous path of honor to the safe source of consulting their own interest with respect to the invasion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.6,to these few we belonged and highly were we honored for it and yet we now fear to perish by having again acted on the same principles and chosen to act well with athens sooner than wisely with sparta
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.56.7,yet in justice the same cases should be decided in the same way and policy should not mean anything else than lasting gratitude for the service of a good ally combined with a proper attention to one s own immediate interest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.57.1,consider also that at present the hellenes generally regard you as a pattern of worth and honor and if you pass an unjust sentence upon us in this which is no obscure cause but one in which you the judges are as illustrious as we the prisoners are blameless take care that displeasure be not felt at an unworthy decision in the matter of honorable men made by men yet more honorable than they and at the consecration in the national temples of spoils taken from the plataeans the benefactors of hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.57.2,shocking indeed will it seem for lacedaemonians to destroy plataea and for the city whose name your fathers inscribed upon the tripod at delphi for its good service to be by you blotted out from the map of hellas to please the thebans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.57.3,to such a depth of misfortune have we fallen that while the medes success had been our ruin thebans now supplant us in your once fond regards and we have been subjected to two dangers the greatest of any that of dying of starvation then if we had not surrendered our town and now of being tried for our lives
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.57.4,so that we plataeans after exertions beyond our power in the cause of the hellenes are rejected by all forsaken and unassisted helped by none of our allies and reduced to doubt the stability of our only hope yourselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.58.1,still in the name of the gods who once presided over our confederacy and of our own good service in the hellenic cause we adjure you to relent to recall the decision which we fear that the thebans may have obtained from you to ask back the gift that you have given them that they disgrace not you by slaying us to gain a pure instead of a guilty gratitude and not to gratify others to be yourselves rewarded with shame
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.58.2,our lives may be quickly taken but it will be a heavy task to wipe away the infamy of the deed as we are no enemies whom you might justly punish but friends forced into taking arms against you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.58.3,to grant us our lives would be therefore a righteous judgment if you consider also that we are prisoners who surrendered of their own accord stretching out our hands for quarter whose slaughter hellenic law forbids and who besides were always your benefactors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.58.4,look at the sepulchres of your fathers slain by the medes and buried in our country whom year by year we honored with garments and all other dues and the first fruits of all that our land produced in their season as friends from a friendly country and allies to our old companions in arms should you not decide aright your conduct would be the very opposite to ours consider only
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.58.5,pausanias buried them thinking that he was laying them in friendly ground and among men as friendly but you if you kill us and make the plataean territory theban will leave your fathers and kinsmen in a hostile soil and among their murderers deprived of the honors which they now enjoy what is more you will enslave the land in which the freedom of the hellenes was won make desolate the temples of the gods to whom they prayed before they overcame the medes and take away your ancestral sacrifices from those who founded and instituted them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.59.1,it were not to your glory lacedaemonians either to offend in this way against the common law of the hellenes and against your own ancestors or to kill us your benefactors to gratify another s hatred without having been wronged yourselves it were more so to spare us and to yield to the impressions of a reasonable compassion reflecting not merely on the awful fate in store for us but also on the character of the sufferers and on the impossibility of predicting how soon misfortune may fall even upon those who deserve it not
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.59.2,we as we have a right to do and as our need impels us entreat you calling aloud upon the gods at whose common altar all the hellenes worship to hear our request to be not unmindful of the oaths which your fathers swore and which we now plead we supplicate you by the tombs of your fathers and appeal to those that are gone to save us from falling into the hands of the thebans and their dearest friends from being given up to their most detested foes we also remind you of that day on which we did the most glorious deeds by your fathers sides we who now on this are like to suffer the most dreadful fate
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.59.3,finally to do what is necessary and yet most difficult for men in our situation that is to make an end of speaking since with that ending the peril of our lives draws near
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.59.4,in conclusion we say that we did not surrender our city to the thebans to that we would have preferred inglorious starvation but trusted in and capitulated to you and it would be just if we fail to persuade you to put us back in the same position and let us take the chance that falls to us and at the same time we adjure you not to give us up your suppliants lacedaemonians out of your hands and faith plataeans foremost of the hellenic patriots to thebans our most hated enemies but to be our saviours and not while you free the rest of the hellenes to bring us to destruction
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.60.1,such were the words of the plataeans the thebans afraid that the lacedaemonians might be moved by what they had heard came forward and said that they too desired to address them since the plataeans had against their wish been allowed to speak at length instead of being confined to a simple answer to the question leave being granted the thebans spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.61.1,we should never have asked to make this speech if the plataeans on their side had contented themselves with shortly answering the question and had not turned round and made charges against us coupled with a long defence of themselves upon matters outside the present inquiry and not even the subject of accusation and with praise of what no one finds fault with however since they have done so we must answer their charges and refute their selfpraise in order that neither our bad name nor their good may help them but that you may hear the real truth on both points and so decide
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.61.2,the origin of our quarrel was this we settled plataea some time after the rest of boeotia together with other places out of which we had driven the mixed population the plataeans not choosing to recognize our supremacy as had been first arranged but separating themselves from the rest of the boeotians and proving traitors to their nationality we used compulsion upon which they went over to the athenians and with them did us much harm for which we retaliated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.62.1,next when the barbarian invaded hellas they say that they were the only boeotians who did not medise and this is where they most glorify themselves and abuse us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.62.2,we say that if they did not medise it was because the athenians did not do so either just as afterwards when the athenians attacked the hellenes they the plataeans were again the only boeotians who atticized
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.62.3,and yet consider the forms of our respective governments when we so acted our city at that juncture had neither an oligarchical constitution in which all the nobles enjoyed equal rights nor a democracy but that which is most opposed to law and good government and nearest a tyranny the rule of a close cabal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.62.4,these hoping to strengthen their individual power by the success of the mede kept down by force the people and brought him into the town the city as a whole was not its own mistress when it so acted and ought not to be reproached for the errors that it committed while deprived of its constitution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.62.5,examine only how we acted after the departure of the mede and the recovery of the constitution when the athenians attacked the rest of hellas and endeavored to subjugate our country of the greater part of which faction had already made them masters did not we fight and conquer at coronea and liberate boeotia and do we not now actively contribute to the liberation of the rest providing horses to the cause and a force unequalled by that of any other state in the confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.63.1,let this suffice to excuse us for our medism we will now endeavor to show that you have injured the hellenes more than we and are more deserving of condign punishment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.63.2,it was in defence against us say you that you became allies and citizens of athens if so you ought only to have called in the athenians against us instead of joining them in attacking others it was open to you to do this if you ever felt that they were leading you where you did not wish to follow as lacedaemon was already your ally against the mede as you so much insist and this was surely sufficient to keep us off and above all to allow you to deliberate in security nevertheless of your own choice and without compulsion you chose to throw your lot in with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.63.3,and you say that it had been base for you to betray your benefactors but it was surely far baser and more iniquitous to sacrifice the whole body of the hellenes your fellowconfederates who were liberating hellas than the athenians only who were enslaving it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.63.4,the return that you made them was therefore neither equal nor honorable since you called them in as you say because you were being oppressed yourselves and then became their accomplices in oppressing others although baseness rather consists in not returning like for like than in not returning what is justly due but must be unjustly paid
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.64.1,meanwhile after thus plainly showing that it was not for the sake of the hellenes that you alone then did not medise but because the athenians did not do so either and you wished to side with them and to be against the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.64.2,you now claim the benefit of good deeds done to please your neighbors this cannot be admitted you chose the athenians and with them you must stand or fall nor can you plead the league then made and claim that it should now protect you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.64.3,you abandoned that league and offended against it by helping instead of hindering the subjugation of the aeginetans and others of its members and that not under compulsion but while in enjoyment of the same institutions that you enjoy to the present hour and no one forcing you as in our case lastly an invitation was addressed to you before you were blockaded to be neutral and join neither party this you did not accept
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.64.4,who then merit the detestation of the hellenes more justly than you you who sought their ruin under the mask of honor the former virtues that you allege you now show not to be proper to your character the real bent of your nature has been at length damningly proved when the athenians took the path of injustice you followed them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.64.5,of our unwilling medism and your willful atticizing this then is our explanation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.65.1,the last wrong of which you complain consists in our having as you say lawlessly invaded your town in time of peace and festival here again we cannot think that we were more in fault than yourselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.65.2,if of our own proper motion we made an armed attack upon your city and ravaged your territory we are guilty but if the first men among you in estate and family wishing to put an end to the foreign connection and to restore you to the common boeotian country of their own free will invited us wherein is our crime where wrong is done those who lead as you say are more to blame than those who follow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.65.3,not that in our judgment wrong was done either by them or by us citizens like yourselves and with more at stake than you they opened their own walls and introduced us into their own city not as foes but as friends to prevent the bad among you from becoming worse to give honest men their due to reform principles without attacking persons since you were not to be banished from your city but brought home to your kindred nor to be made enemies to any but friends alike to all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.66.1,that our intention was not hostile is proved by our behavior we did no harm to any one but publicly invited those who wished to live under a national boeotian government to come over to us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.66.2,which at first you gladly did and made an agreement with us and remained tranquil until you became aware of the smallness of our numbers now it is possible that there may have been something not quite fair in our entering without the consent of your commons at any rate you did not repay us in kind instead of refraining as we had done from violence and inducing us to retire by negotiation you fell upon us in violation of your agreement and slew some of us in fight of which we do not so much complain for in that there was a certain justice but others who held out their hands and received quarter and whose lives you subsequently promised us you lawlessly butchered if this was not abominable what is
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.66.3,and after these three crimes committed one after the other the violation of your agreement the murder of the men afterwards and the lying breach of your promise not to kill them if we refrained from injuring your property in the country you still affirm that we are the criminals and yourselves pretend to escape justice not so if these your judges decide aright but you will be punished for all together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.1,such lacedaemonians are the facts we have gone into them at some length both on your account and on our own that you may feel that you will justly condemn the prisoners and we that we have given an additional sanction to our vengeance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.2,we would also prevent you from being melted by hearing of their past virtues if any such they had these may be fairly appealed to by the victims of injustice but only aggravate the guilt of criminals since they offend against their better nature nor let them gain anything by crying and wailing by calling upon your fathers tombs and their own desolate condition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.3,against this we point to the far more dreadful fate of our youth butchered at their hands the fathers of whom either fell at coronea bringing boeotia over to you or seated forlorn old men by desolate hearths who with far more reason implore your justice upon the prisoners
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.4,the pity which they appeal to is rather due to men who suffer unworthily those who suffer justly as they do are on the contrary subjects for triumph
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.5,for their present desolate condition they have themselves to blame since they willfully rejected the better alliance their lawless act was not provoked by any action of ours hate not justice inspired their decision and even now the satisfaction which they afford us is not adequate they will suffer by a legal sentence not as they pretend as suppliants asking for quarter in battle but as prisoners who have surrendered upon agreement to take their trial
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.6,vindicate therefore lacedaemonians the hellenic law which they have broken and to us the victims of its violation grant the reward merited by our zeal nor let us be supplanted in your favour by their harangues but offer an example to the hellenes that the contests to which you invite them are of deeds not words good deeds can be shortly stated but where wrong is done a wealth of language is needed to veil its deformity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.67.7,however if leading powers were to do what you are now doing and putting one short question all alike were to decide accordingly men would be less tempted to seek fine phrases to cover bad actions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.68.1,such were the words of the thebans the lacedaemonian judges decided that the question whether they had received any service from the plataeans in the war was a fair one for them to put as they had always invited them to be neutral agreeably to the original covenant of pausanias after the defeat of the mede and had again definitely offered them the same conditions before the blockade this offer having been refused they were now they conceived by the loyalty of their intention released from their covenant and having as they considered suffered evil at the hands of the plataeans they brought them in again one by one and asked each of them the same question that is to say whether they had done the lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war and upon their saying that they had not took them out and slew them all without exception
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.68.2,the number of plataeans thus massacred was not less than two hundred with twentyfive athenians who had shared in the siege the women were taken as slaves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.68.3,the city the thebans gave for about a year to some political emigrants from megara and to the surviving plataeans of their own party to inhabit and afterwards razed it to the ground from the very foundations and built on to the precinct of hera an inn two hundred feet square with rooms all round above and below making use for this purpose of the roofs and doors of the plataeans of the rest of the materials in the wall the brass and the iron they made couches which they dedicated to hera for whom they also built a stone chapel of a hundred feet square the land they confiscated and let out on a tenyears lease to theban occupiers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.68.4,the adverse attitude of the lacedaemonians in the whole plataean affair was mainly adopted to please the thebans who were thought to be useful in the war at that moment raging
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.68.5,such was the end of plataea in the ninetythird year after she became the ally of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.69.1,meanwhile the forty ships of the peloponnesians that had gone to the relief of the lesbians and which we left flying across the open sea pursued by the athenians were caught in a storm off crete and scattering from thence made their way to peloponnese where they found at cyllene thirteen leucadian and ambraciot triremes with brasidas son of tellis lately arrived as counsellor to alcidas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.69.2,the lacedaemonians upon the failure of the lesbian expedition having resolved to strengthen their fleet and sail to corcyra where a revolution had broken out so as to arrive there before the twelve athenian ships at naupactus could be reinforced from athens brasidas and alcidas began to prepare accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.70.1,the corcyraean revolution began with the return of the prisoners taken in the seafights off epidamnus these the corinthians had released nominally upon the security of eight hundred talents given by their proxeni but in reality upon their engagement to bring over corcyra to corinth these men proceeded to canvass each of the citizens and to intrigue with the view of detaching the city from athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.70.2,upon the arrival of an athenian and a corinthian vessel with envoys on board a conference was held in which the corcyraeans voted to remain allies of the athenians according to their agreement but to be friends of the peloponnesians as they had been formerly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.70.3,meanwhile the returned prisoners brought peithias a volunteer proxenus of the athenians and leader of the commons to trial upon the charge of enslaving corcyra to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.70.4,he being acquitted retorted by accusing five of the richest of their number of cutting stakes in the ground sacred to zeus and alcinous the legal penalty being a stater for each stake
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.70.5,upon their conviction the amount of the penalty being very large they seated themselves as suppliants in the temples to be allowed to pay it by instalments but peithias who was one of the senate prevailed upon that body to enforce the law
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.70.6,upon which the accused rendered desperate by the law and also learning that peithias had the intention while still a member of the senate to persuade the people to conclude a defensive and offensive alliance with athens banded together armed with daggers and suddenly bursting into the senate killed peithias and sixty others senators and private persons some few only of the party of peithias taking refuge in the athenian trireme which had not yet departed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.71.1,after this outrage the conspirators summoned the corcyraeans to an assembly and said that this would turn out for the best and would save them from being enslaved by athens for the future they moved to receive neither party unless they came peacefully in a single ship treating any larger number as enemies this motion made they compelled it to be adopted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.71.2,and instantly sent off envoys to athens to justify what had been done and to dissuade the refugees there from any hostile proceedings which might lead to a reaction
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.72.1,upon the arrival of the embassy the athenians arrested the envoys and all who listened to them as revolutionists and lodged them in aegina
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.72.2,meanwhile a corinthian trireme arriving in the island with lacedaemonian envoys the dominant corcyraean party attacked the commons and defeated them in battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.72.3,night coming on the commons took refuge in the acropolis and the higher parts of the city and concentrated themselves there having also possession of the hyllaic harbor their adversaries occupying the marketplace where most of them lived and the harbor adjoining looking towards the mainland
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.73.1,the next day passed in skirmishes of little importance each party sending into the country to offer freedom to the slaves and to invite them to join them the mass of the slaves answered the appeal of the commons their antagonists being reinforced by eight hundred mercenaries from the continent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.74.1,after a day s interval hostilities recommenced victory remaining with the commons who had the advantage in numbers and position the women also valiantly assisting them pelting with tiles from the houses and supporting the melee with a fortitude beyond their sex

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.82.1,so bloody was the march of the revolution and the impression which it made was the greater as it was one of the first to occur later on one may say the whole hellenic world was convulsed struggles being everywhere made by the popular chiefs to bring in the athenians and by the oligarchs to introduce the lacedaemonians in peace there would have been neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation but in war with an alliance always at the command of either faction for the hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage opportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the revolutionary parties
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.82.2,the sufferings which revolution entailed upon the cities were many and terrible such as have occurred and always will occur as long as the nature of mankind remains the same though in a severer or milder form and varying in their symptoms according to the variety of the particular cases in peace and prosperity states and individuals have better sentiments because they do not find themselves suddenly confronted with imperious necessities but war takes away the easy supply of daily wants and so proves a rough master that brings most men s characters to a level with their fortunes

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.82.7,the fair proposals of an adversary were met with jealous precautions by the stronger of the two and not with a generous confidence revenge also was held of more account than selfpreservation oaths of reconciliation being only proffered on either side to meet an immediate difficulty only held good so long as no other weapon was at hand but when opportunity offered he who first ventured to seize it and to take his enemy off his guard thought this perfidious vengeance sweeter than an open one since considerations of safety apart success by treachery won him the palm of superior intelligence indeed it is generally the case that men are readier to call rogues clever than simpletons honest and are as ashamed of being the second as they are proud of being the first
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.82.8,the cause of all these evils was the lust for power arising from greed and ambition and from these passions proceeded the violence of parties once engaged in contention the leaders in the cities each provided with the fairest professions on the one side with the cry of political equality of the people on the other of a moderate aristocracy sought prizes for themselves in those public interests which they pretended to cherish and recoiling from no means in their struggles for ascendancy engaged in the direct excesses in their acts of vengeance they went to even greater lengths not stopping at what justice or the good of the state demanded but making the party caprice of the moment their only standard and invoking with equal readiness the condemnation of an unjust verdict or the authority of the strong arm to glut the animosities of the hour thus religion was in honor with neither party but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high reputation meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished between the two either for not joining in the quarrel or because envy would not suffer them to escape

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.83.2,to put an end to this there was neither promise to be depended upon nor oath that could command respect but all parties dwelling rather in their calculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things were more intent upon selfdefence than capable of confidence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.83.3,in this contest the blunter wits were most successful apprehensive of their own deficiencies and of the cleverness of their antagonists they feared to be worsted in debate and to be surprised by the combinations of their more versatile opponents and so at once boldly had recourse to action

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.84.2,in the confusion into which life was now thrown in the cities human nature always rebelling against the law and now its master gladly showed itself ungoverned in passion above respect for justice and the enemy of all superiority since revenge would not have been set above religion and gain above justice had it not been for the fatal power of envy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.84.3,indeed men too often take upon themselves in the prosecution of their revenge to set the example of doing away with those general laws to which all alike can look for salvation in adversity instead of allowing them to subsist against the day of danger when their aid may be required

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.93.1,the foundation of this town evidently meant to annoy euboea the passage across to cenaeum in that island being a short one at first caused some alarm at athens which the event however did nothing to justify the town never giving them any trouble
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.93.2,the reason of this was as follows the thessalians who were sovereign in those parts and whose territory was menaced by its foundation were afraid that it might prove a very powerful neighbor and accordingly continually harassed and made war upon the new settlers until they at last wore them out in spite of their originally considerable numbers people flocking from all quarters to a place founded by the lacedaemonians and thus thought secure of prosperity on the other hand the lacedaemonians themselves in the persons of their governors did their full share towards ruining its prosperity and reducing its population as they frightened away the greater part of the inhabitants by governing harshly and in some cases not fairly and thus made it easier for their neighbors to prevail against them

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.104.2,all the sepulchres of those that had died in delos were taken up and for the future it was commanded that no one should be allowed either to die or to give birth to a child in the island but that they should be carried over to rhenea which is so near to delos that polycrates tyrant of samos having added rhenea to his other island conquests during his period of naval ascendancy dedicated it to the delian apollo by binding it to delos with a chain the athenians after the purification celebrated for the first time the quinquennial festival of the delian games

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.104.5,that there was also a poetical contest in which the ionians went to contend again is shown by the following taken from the same hymn after celebrating the delian dance of the women he ends his song of praise with these verses in which he also alludes to himself well may apollo keep you all and so sweethearts goodbye yet tell me not i goout from your hearts and if in after hourssome other wanderer in this world of ourstouch at your shores and ask your maidens herewho sings the songs the sweetest to your ear think of me then and answer with a smile a blind old man of chios rocky isle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.104.6,homer thus attests that there was anciently a great assembly and festival at delos in later times although the islanders and the athenians continued to send the choirs of dancers with sacrifices the contests and most of the ceremonies were abolished probably through adversity until the athenians celebrated the games upon this occasion with the novelty of horseraces

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.115.6,meanwhile pythodorus had taken the command of laches ships and towards the end of winter sailed against the locrian fort which laches had formerly taken and returned after being defeated in battle by the locrians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.116.1,in the first days of this spring the stream of fire issued from etna as on former occasions and destroyed some land of the catanians who live upon mount etna which is the largest mountain in sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.116.2,fifty years it is said had elapsed since the last eruption there having been three in all since the hellenes have inhabited sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:3.116.3,such were the events of this winter and with it ended the sixth year of this war of which thucydides was the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.1.1,next summer about the time of the corn s coming into ear ten syracusan and as many locrian vessels sailed to messina in sicily and occupied the town upon the invitation of the inhabitants and messina revolted from the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.1.2,the syracusans contrived this chiefly because they saw that the place afforded an approach to sicily and feared that the athenians might hereafter use it as a base for attacking them with a larger force the locrians because they wished to carry on hostilities from both sides of the strait and to reduce their enemies the people of rhegium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.1.3,meanwhile the locrians had invaded the rhegian territory with all their forces to prevent their succoring messina and also at the instance of some exiles from rhegium who were with them the long factions by which that town had been torn rendering it for the moment incapable of resistance and thus furnishing an additional temptation to the invaders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.1.4,after devastating the country the locrian land forces retired their ships remaining to guard messina while others were being manned for the same destination to carry on the war from thence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.2.1,about the same time in the spring before the corn was ripe the peloponnesians and their allies invaded attica under agis the son of archidamus king of the lacedaemonians and sat down and laid waste the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.2.2,meanwhile the athenians sent off the forty ships which they had been preparing to sicily with the remaining generals eurymedon and sophocles
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.2.3,their colleague pythodorus having already preceded them thither these had also instructions as they sailed by to look to the corcyraeans in the town who were being plundered by the exiles in the mountain to support these exiles sixty peloponnesian vessels had lately sailed it being thought that the famine raging in the city would make it easy for them to reduce it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.2.4,demosthenes also who had remained without employment since his return from acarnania applied and obtained permission to use the fleet if he wished it upon the coast of peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.3.1,off laconia they heard that the peloponnesian ships were already at corcyra upon which eurymedon and sophocles wished to hasten to the island but demosthenes required them first to touch at pylos and do what was wanted there before continuing their voyage while they were making objections a squall chanced to come on and carried the fleet into pylos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.3.2,demosthenes at once urged them to fortify the place it being for this that he had come on the voyage and made them observe there was plenty of stone and timber on the spot and that the place was strong by nature and together with much of the country round unoccupied pylos or coryphasium as the lacedaemonians call it being about fortyfive miles distant from sparta and situated in the old country of the messenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.3.3,the commanders told him that there was no lack of desert headlands in peloponnese if he wished to put the city to expense by occupying them he however thought that this place was distinguished from others of the kind by having a harbour close by while the messenians the old natives of the country speaking the same dialect as the lacedaemonians could do them the greatest mischief by their incursions from it and would at the same time be a trusty garrison
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.4.1,after speaking to the captains of companies on the subject and failing to persuade either the generals or the soldiers he remained inactive with the rest from stress of weather until the soldiers themselves wanting occupation were seized with a sudden impulse to go round and fortify the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.4.2,accordingly they set to work in earnest and having no iron tools picked up stones and put them together as they happened to fit and where mortar was needed carried it on their backs for want of hods stooping down to make it stay on and clasping their hands together behind to prevent it falling off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.4.3,sparing no effort to be able to complete the most vulnerable points before the arrival of the lacedaemonians most of the place being sufficiently strong by nature without further fortification
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.5.1,meanwhile the lacedaemonians were celebrating a festival and also at first made light of the news in the idea that whenever they chose to take the field the place would be immediately evacuated by the enemy or easily taken by force the absence of their army before athens having also something to do with their delay
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.5.2,the athenians fortified the place on the land side and where it most required it in six days and leaving demosthenes with five ships to garrison it with the main body of the fleet hastened on their voyage to corcyra and sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.6.1,as soon as the peloponnesians in attica heard of the occupation of pylos they hurried back home the lacedaemonians and their king agis thinking that the matter touched them nearly besides having made their invasion early in the season and while the corn was still green most of their troops were short of provisions the weather also was unusually bad for the time of year and greatly distressed their army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.6.2,many reasons thus combined to hasten their departure and to make this invasion a very short one indeed they only stayed fifteen days in attica
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.7.1,about the same time the athenian general simonides getting together a few athenians from the garrisons and a number of the allies in those parts took eion in thrace a mendaean colony and hostile to athens by treachery but had no sooner done so than the chalcidians and bottiaeans came up and beat him out of it with the loss of many of his soldiers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.1,on the return of the peloponnesians from attica the spartans themselves and the nearest of the perioeci at once set out for pylos the other lacedaemonians following more slowly as they had just come in from another campaign
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.2,word was also sent round peloponnese to come up as quickly as possible to pylos while the sixty peloponnesian ships were sent for from corcyra and being dragged by their crews across the isthmus of leucas passed unperceived by the athenian squadron at zacynthus and reached pylos where the land forces had arrived before them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.3,before the peloponnesian fleet sailed in demosthenes found time to send out unobserved two ships to inform eurymedon and the athenians on board the fleet at zacynthus of the danger of pylos and to summon them to his assistance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.4,while the ships hastened on their voyage in obedience to the orders of demosthenes the lacedaemonians prepared to assault the fort by land and sea hoping to capture with ease a work constructed in haste and held by a feeble garrison
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.5,meanwhile as they expected the athenian ships to arrive from zacynthus they intended if they failed to take the place before to block up the entrance of the harbour to prevent their being able to anchor inside it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.6,for the island of sphacteria stretching along in a line close in front of the harbour at once makes it safe and narrows its entrances leaving a passage for two ships on the side nearest pylos and the athenian fortifications and for eight or nine on that next the rest of the mainland for the rest the island was entirely covered with wood and without paths through not being inhabited and about one mile and five furlongs in length
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.7,the inlets the lacedaemonians meant to close with a line of ships placed close together with their prows turned towards the sea and meanwhile fearing that the enemy might make use of the island to operate against them carried over some heavy infantry thither stationing others along the coast
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.8,by this means the island and the continent would be alike hostile to the athenians as they would be unable to land on either and the shore of pylos itself outside the inlet towards the open sea having no harbour and therefore presenting no point which they could use as a base to relieve their countrymen they the lacedaemonians without seafight or risk would in all probability become masters of the place occupied as it had been on the spur of the moment and unfurnished with provisions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.8.9,this being determined they carried over to the island the heavy infantry drafted by lot from all the companies some others had crossed over before in relief parties but these last who were left there were four hundred and twenty in number with their helot attendants commanded by epitadas son of molobrus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.9.1,meanwhile demosthenes seeing the lacedaemonians about to attack him by sea and land at once himself was not idle he drew up under the fortification and enclosed in a stockade the galleys remaining to him of those which had been left him arming the sailors taken out of them with poor shields made most of them of osier it being impossible to procure arms in such a desert place and even these having been obtained from a thirtyoared messenian privateer and a boat belonging to some messenians who happened to have come to them among these messenians were forty heavy infantry whom he made use of with the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.9.2,posting most of his men unarmed and armed upon the best fortified and strong points of the place towards the interior with orders to repel any attack of the land forces he picked sixty heavy infantry and a few archers from his whole force and with these went outside the wall down to the sea where he thought that the enemy would most likely attempt to land although the ground was difficult and rocky looking towards the open sea the fact that this was the weakest part of the wall would he thought encourage their ardor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.9.3,as the athenians confident in their naval superiority had here paid little attention to their defences and the enemy if he could force a landing might feel secure of taking the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.9.4,at this point accordingly going down to the water s edge he posted his heavy infantry to prevent if possible a landing and encouraged them in the following terms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.10.1,soldiers and comrades in this adventure i hope that none of you in our present strait will think to show his wit by exactly calculating all the perils that encompass us but that you will rather hasten to close with the enemy without staying to count the odds seeing in this your best chance of safety in emergencies like ours calculation is out of place the sooner the danger is faced the better
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.10.2,to my mind also most of the chances are for us if we will only stand fast and not throw away our advantages overawed by the numbers of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.10.3,one of the points in our favour is the awkwardness of the landing this however only helps us if we stand our ground if we give way it will be practicable enough in spite of its natural difficulty without a defender and the enemy will instantly become more formidable from the difficulty he will have in retreating supposing that we succeed in repulsing him which we shall find it easier to do while he is on board his ships than after he has landed and meets us on equal terms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.10.4,as to his numbers these need not too much alarm you large as they may be he can only engage in small detachments from the impossibility of bringing to besides the numerical superiority that we have to meet is not that of an army on land with everything else equal but of troops on board ship upon an element where many favorable accidents are required to act with effect
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.10.5,i therefore consider that his difficulties may be fairly set against our numerical deficiencies and at the same time i charge you as athenians who know by experience what landing from ships on a hostile territory means and how impossible it is to drive back an enemy determined enough to stand his ground and not to be frightened away by the surf and the terrors of the ships sailing in to stand fast in the present emergency beat back the enemy at the water s edge and save yourselves and the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.11.1,thus encouraged by demosthenes the athenians felt more confident and went down to meet the enemy posting themselves along the edge of the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.11.2,the lacedaemonians now put themselves in movement and simultaneously assaulted the fortification with their land forces and with their ships fortythree in number under their admiral thrasymelidas son of cratesicles a spartan who made his attack just where demosthenes expected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.11.3,the athenians had thus to defend themselves on both sides from the land and from the sea the enemy rowing up in small detachments the one relieving the other it being impossible for many to bring to at once and showing great ardor and cheering each other on in the endeavor to force a passage and to take the fortification
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.11.4,he who most distinguished himself was brasidas captain of a galley and seeing that the captains and steersmen impressed by the difficulty of the position hung back even where a landing might have seemed possible for fear of wrecking their vessels he shouted out to them that they must never allow the enemy to fortify himself in their country for the sake of saving timber but must shiver their vessels and force a landing and bade the allies instead of hesitating in such a moment to sacrifice their ships for lacedaemon in return for her many benefits to run them boldly aground land in one way or another and make themselves masters of the place and its garrison
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.12.1,not content with this exhortation he forced his own steersman to run his ship ashore and stepping on to the gangway was endeavoring to land when he was cut down by the athenians and after receiving many wounds fainted away falling into the bows his shield slipped off his arm into the sea and being thrown ashore was picked up by the athenians and afterwards used for the trophy which they set up for this attack
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.12.2,the rest also did their best but were not able to land owing to the difficulty of the ground and the unflinching tenacity of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.12.3,it was a strange reversal of the order of things for athenians to be fighting from the lands and from laconian land too against lacedaemonians coming from the sea while lacedaemonians were trying to land from shipboard in their own country now become hostile to attack athenians although the former were chiefly famous at the time as an inland people and superior by land the latter as a maritime people with a navy that had no equal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.13.1,after continuing their attacks during that day and most of the next the peloponnesians desisted and the day after sent some of their ships to asine for timber to make engines hoping to take by their aid in spite of its height the wall opposite the harbour where the landing was easiest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.13.2,at this moment the athenian fleet from zacynthus arrived now numbering fifty sail having been reinforced by some of the ships on guard at naupactus and by four chian vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.13.3,seeing the coast and the island both crowded with heavy infantry and the hostile ships in harbour showing no signs of sailing out at a loss where to anchor they sailed for the moment to the desert island of prote not far off where they passed the night the next day they got under weigh in readiness to engage in the open sea if the enemy chose to put out to meet them being determined in the event of his not doing so to sail in and attack him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.13.4,the lacedaemonians did not put out to sea and having omitted to close the inlets as they had intended remained quiet on shore engaged in manning their ships and getting ready in the case of any one sailing in to fight in the harbour which is a fairly large one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.14.1,perceiving this the athenians advanced against them by each inlet and falling on the enemy s fleet most of which was by this time afloat and in line at once put it to flight and giving chase as far as the short distance allowed disabled a good many vessels and took five one with its crew on board dashing in at the rest that had taken refuge on shore and battering some that were still being manned before they could put out and lashing on to their own ships and towing off empty others whose crews had fled
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.14.2,at this sight the lacedaemonians maddened by a disaster which cut off their men on the island rushed to the rescue and going into the sea with their heavy armour laid hold of the ships and tried to drag them back each man thinking that success depended on his individual exertions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.14.3,great was the melee and quite in contradiction to the naval tactics usual to the two combatants the lacedaemonians in their excitement and dismay being actually engaged in a seafight on land while the victorious athenians in their eagerness to push their success as far as possible were carrying on a landfight from their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.14.4,after great exertions and numerous wounds on both sides they separated the lacedaemonians saving their empty ships except those first taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.14.5,and both parties returning to their camp the athenians set up a trophy gave back the dead secured the wrecks and at once began to cruise round and jealously watch the island with its intercepted garrison while the peloponnesians on the mainland whose contingents had now all come up stayed where they were before pylos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.15.1,when the news of what had happened at pylos reached sparta the disaster was thought so serious that the lacedaemonians resolved that the authorities should go down to the camp and decide on the spot what was best to be done
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.15.2,there seeing that it was impossible to help their men and not wishing to risk their being reduced by hunger or overpowered by numbers they determined with the consent of the athenian generals to conclude an armistice at pylos and send envoys to athens to obtain a convention and to endeavor to get back their men as quickly as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.16.1,the generals accepting their offers an armistice was concluded upon the terms following that the lacedaemonians should bring to pylos and deliver up to the athenians the ships that had fought in the late engagement and all in laconia that were vessels of war and should make no attack on the fortification either by land or by sea that the athenians should allow the lacedaemonians on the mainland to send to the men in the island a certain fixed quantity of corn ready kneaded that is to say two quarts of barley meal one pint of wine and a piece of meat for each man and half the same quantity for a servant that this allowance should be sent in under the eyes of the athenians and that no boat should sail to the island except openly that the athenians should continue to guard the island the same as before without however landing upon it and should refrain from attacking the peloponnesian troops either by land or by sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.16.2,that if either party should infringe any of these terms in the slightest particular the armistice should be at once void that the armistice should hold good until the return of the lacedaemonian envoys from athens the athenians sending them thither in a galley and bringing them back again and upon the arrival of the envoys should be at an end and the ships be restored by the athenians in the same state as they received them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.16.3,such were the terms of the armistice and the ships were delivered over to the number of sixty and the envoys sent off accordingly arrived at athens they spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.17.1,athenians the lacedaemonians sent us to try to find some way of settling the affair of our men on the island that shall be at once satisfactory to your interests and as consistent with our dignity in our misfortune as circumstances permit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.17.2,we can venture to speak at some length without any departure from the habit of our country men of few words where many are not wanted we can be less brief when there is a matter of importance to be illustrated and an end to be served by its illustration
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.17.3,meanwhile we beg you to take what we may say not in a hostile spirit nor as if we thought you ignorant and wished to lecture you but rather as a suggestion on the best course to be taken addressed to intelligent judges
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.17.4,you can now if you choose employ your present success to advantage so as to keep what you have got and gain honor and reputation besides and you can avoid the mistake of those who meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune and are led on by hope to grasp continually at something further through having already succeeded without expecting it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.17.5,while those who have known most vicissitudes of good and bad have also justly least faith in their prosperity and to teach your city and ours this lesson experience has not been wanting
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.18.1,to be convinced of this you have only to look at our present misfortune what power in hellas stood higher than we did and yet we are come to you although we formerly thought ourselves more able to grant what we are now here to ask
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.18.2,nevertheless we have not been brought to this by any decay in our power or through having our heads turned by aggrandizement no our resources are what they have always been and our error has been an error of judgment to which all are equally liable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.18.3,accordingly the prosperity which your city now enjoys and the accession that it has lately received must not make you fancy that fortune will be always with you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.18.4,indeed sensible men are prudent enough to treat their gains as precarious just as they would also keep a clear head in adversity and think that war so far from staying within the limit to which a combatant may wish to confine it will run the course that its chances prescribe and thus not being puffed up by confidence in military success they are less likely to come to grief and most ready to make peace if they can while their fortune lasts
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.18.5,this athenians you have a good opportunity to do now with us and thus to escape the possible disasters which may follow upon your refusal and the consequent imputation of having owed to accident even your present advantages when you might have left behind you a reputation for power and wisdom which nothing could endanger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.19.1,the lacedaemonians accordingly invite you to make a treaty and to end the war and offer peace and alliance and the most friendly and intimate relations in every way and on every occasion between us and in return ask for the men on the island thinking it better for both parties not to stand out the end on the chance of some favorable accident enabling the men to force their way out or of their being compelled to succumb under the pressure of blockade
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.19.2,indeed if great enmities are ever to be really settled we think it will be not by the system of revenge and military success and by forcing an opponent to swear to a treaty to his disadvantage but when the more fortunate combatant waives these his privileges to be guided by gentler feelings conquers his rival in generosity and accords peace on more moderate conditions than he expected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.19.3,from that moment instead of the debt of revenge which violence must entail his adversary owes a debt of generosity to be paid in kind and is inclined by honor to stand to his agreement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.19.4,and men oftener act in this manner towards their greatest enemies than where the quarrel is of less importance they are also by nature as glad to give way to those who first yield to them as they are apt to be provoked by arrogance to risks condemned by their own judgment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.20.1,to apply this to ourselves if peace was ever desirable for both parties it is surely so at the present moment before anything irremediable befall us and force us to hate you eternally personally as well as politically and you to miss the advantages that we now offer you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.20.2,while the issue is still in doubt and you have reputation and our friendship in prospect and we the compromise of our misfortune before anything fatal occur let us be reconciled and for ourselves choose peace instead of war and grant to the rest of the hellenes a remission from their sufferings for which be sure they will think they have chiefly you to thank the war that they labour under they know not which began but the peace that concludes it as it depends on your decision will by their gratitude he laid to your door
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.20.3,by such a decision you can become firm friends with the lacedaemonians at their own invitation which you do not force from them but oblige them by accepting
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.20.4,and from this friendship consider the advantages that are likely to follow when attica and sparta are at one the rest of hellas be sure will remain in respectful inferiority before its heads
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.21.1,such were the words of the lacedaemonians their idea being that the athenians already desirous of a truce and only kept back by their opposition would joyfully accept a peace freely offered and give back the men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.21.2,the athenians however having the men on the island thought that the treaty would be ready for them whenever they chose to make it and grasped at something further
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.21.3,foremost to encourage them in this policy was cleon son of cleaenetus a popular leader of the time and very powerful with the multitude who persuaded them to answer as follows first the men in the island must surrender themselves and their arms and be brought to athens next the lacedaemonians must restore nisaea pegae troezen and achaia all places acquired not by arms but by the previous convention under which they had been ceded by athens herself at a moment of disaster when a truce was more necessary to her than at present this done they might take back their men and make a truce for as long as both parties might agree
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.22.1,to this answer the envoys made no reply but asked that commissioners might be chosen with whom they might confer on each point and quietly talk the matter over and try to come to some agreement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.22.2,hereupon cleon violently assailed them saying that he knew from the first that they had no right intentions and that it was clear enough now by their refusing to speak before the people and wanting to confer in secret with a committee of two or three no if they meant anything honest let them say it out before all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.22.3,the lacedaemonians however seeing that whatever concessions they might be prepared to make in their misfortune it was impossible for them to speak before the multitude and lose credit with their allies for a negotiation which might after all miscarry and on the other hand that the athenians would never grant what they asked upon moderate terms returned from athens without having effected anything
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.23.1,their arrival at once put an end to the armistice at pylos and the lacedaemonians asked back their ships according to the convention the athenians however alleged an attack on the fort in contravention of the truce and other grievances seemingly not worth mentioning and refused to give them back insisting upon the clause by which the slightest infringement made the armistice void the lacedaemonians after denying the contravention and protesting against their bad faith in the matter of the ships went away and earnestly addressed themselves to the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.23.2,hostilities were now carried on at pylos upon both sides with vigor the athenians cruised round the island all day with two ships going different ways and by night except on the seaward side in windy weather anchored round it with their whole fleet which having been reinforced by twenty ships from athens come to aid in the blockade now numbered seventy sail while the peloponnesians remained encamped on the continent making attacks on the fort and on the lookout for any opportunity which might offer itself for the deliverance of their men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.24.1,meanwhile the syracusans and their allies in sicily had brought up to the squadron guarding messina the reinforcement which we left them preparing and carried on the war from thence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.24.2,incited chiefly by the locrians from hatred of the rhegians whose territory they had invaded with all their forces
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.24.3,the syracusans also wished to try their fortune at sea seeing that the athenians had only a few ships actually at rhegium and hearing that the main fleet destined to join them was engaged in blockading the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.24.4,a naval victory they thought would enable them to blockade rhegium by sea and land and easily to reduce it a success which would at once place their affairs upon a solid basis the promontory of rhegium in italy and messina in sicily being so near each other that it would be impossible for the athenians to cruise against them and command the strait
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.24.5,the strait in question consists of the sea between rhegium and messina at the point where sicily approaches nearest to the continent and is the charybdis through which the story makes ulysses sail and the narrowness of the passage and the strength of the current that pours in from the vast tyrrhenian and sicilian mains have rightly given it a bad reputation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.1,in this strait the syracusans and their allies were compelled to engage late in the day about the passage of a boat putting out with rather more than thirty ships against sixteen athenian and eight rhegian vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.2,defeated by the athenians they hastily set off each for himself to their own stations at messina and rhegium with the loss of one ship night coming on before the battle was finished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.3,after this the locrians retired from the rhegian territory and the ships of the syracusans and their allies united and came to anchor at cape pelorus in the territory of messina where their land forces joined them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.4,here the athenians and rhegians sailed up and seeing the ships unmanned made an attack in which they in their turn lost one vessel which was caught by a grappling iron the crew saving themselves by swimming
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.5,after this the syracusans got on board their ships and while they were being towed along shore to messina were again attacked by the athenians but suddenly got out to sea and became the assailants and caused them to lose another vessel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.6,after thus holding their own in the voyage along shore and in the engagement as above described the syracusans sailed on into the harbour of messina
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.7,meanwhile the athenians having received warning that camarina was about to be betrayed to the syracusans by archias and his party sailed thither and the messinese took this opportunity to attack by sea and land with all their forces their chalcidian neighbor naxos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.8,the first day they forced the naxians to keep their walls and laid waste their country the next they sailed round with their ships and laid waste their land on the river akesines while their land forces menaced the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.9,meanwhile the sicels came down from the high country in great numbers to aid against the messinese and the naxians elated at the sight and animated by a belief that the leontines and their other hellenic allies were coming to their support suddenly sallied out from the town and attacked and routed the messinese killing more than a thousand of them while the remainder suffered severely in their retreat home being attacked by the barbarians on the road and most of them cut off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.10,the ships put in to messina and afterwards dispersed for their different homes the leontines and their allies with the athenians upon this at once turned their arms against the now weakened messina and attacked the athenians with their ships on the side of the harbour and the land forces on that of the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.11,the messinese however sailing out with demoteles and some locrians who had been left to garrison the city after the disaster suddenly attacked and routed most of the leontine army killing a great number upon seeing which the athenians landed from their ships and falling on the messinese in disorder chased them back into the town and setting up a trophy retired to rhegium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.25.12,after this the hellenes in sicily continued to make war on each other by land without the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.1,meanwhile the athenians at pylos were still besieging the lacedaemonians in the island the peloponnesian forces on the continent remaining where they were
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.2,the blockade was very laborious for the athenians from want of food and water there was no spring except one in the citadel of pylos itself and that not a large one and most of them were obliged to grub up the shingle on the sea beach and drink such water as they could find
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.3,they also suffered from want of room being encamped in a narrow space and as there was no anchorage for the ships some took their meals on shore in their turn while the others were anchored out at sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.4,but their greatest discouragement arose from the unexpectedly long time which it took to reduce a body of men shut up in a desert island with only brackish water to drink a matter which they had imagined would take them only a few days
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.5,the fact was that the lacedaemonians had made advertisement for volunteers to carry into the island ground corn wine cheese and any other food useful in a siege high prices being offered and freedom promised to any of the helots who should succeed in doing so
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.6,the helots accordingly were most forward to engage in this risky traffic putting off from this or that part of peloponnese and running in by night on the seaward side of the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.7,they were best pleased however when they could catch a wind to carry them in it was more easy to elude the lookout of the galleys when it blew from the seaward as it became impossible for them to anchor round the island while the helots had their boats rated at their value in money and ran them ashore without caring how they landed being sure to find the soldiers waiting for them at the landingplaces but all who risked it in fair weather were taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.8,divers also swam in under water from the harbour dragging by a cord in skins poppyseed mixed with honey and bruised linseed these at first escaped notice but afterwards a lookout was kept for them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.26.9,in short both sides tried every possible contrivance the one to throw in provisions and the other to prevent their introduction
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.27.1,at athens meanwhile the news that the army was in great distress and that corn found its way in to the men in the island caused no small perplexity and the athenians began to fear that winter might come on and find them still engaged in the blockade they saw that the convoying of provisions round peloponnese would be then impossible the country offered no resources in itself and even in summer they could not send round enough the blockade of a place without harbor could no longer be kept up and the men would either escape by the siege being abandoned or would watch for bad weather and sail out in the boats that brought in their corn
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.27.2,what caused still more alarm was the attitude of the lacedaemonians who must it was thought by the athenians feel themselves on strong ground not to send them any more envoys and they began to repent having rejected the treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.27.3,cleon perceiving the disfavor with which he was regarded for having stood in the way of the convention now said that their informants did not speak the truth and upon the messengers recommending them if they did not believe them to send some commissioners to see cleon himself and theagenes were chosen by the athenians as commissioners
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.27.4,aware that he would now be obliged either to say what had been already said by the men whom he was slandering or be proved a liar if he said the contrary he told the athenians whom he saw to be not altogether disinclined for a fresh expedition that instead of sending commissioners and wasting their time and opportunities if they believed what was told them they ought to sail against the men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.27.5,and pointing at nicias son of niceratus then general whom he hated he tauntingly said that it would be easy if they had men for generals to sail with a force and take those in the island and that if he had himself been in command he would have done it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.28.1,nicias seeing the athenians murmuring against cleon for not sailing now if it seemed to him so easy and further seeing himself the object of attack told him that for all that the generals cared he might take what force he chose and make the attempt
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.28.2,at first cleon fancied that this resignation was merely a figure of speech and was ready to go but finding that it was seriously meant he drew back and said that nicias not he was general being now frightened and having never supposed that nicias would go so far as to retire in his favour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.28.3,nicias however repeated his offer and resigned the command against pylos and called the athenians to witness that he did so and as the multitude is wont to do the more cleon shrank from the expedition and tried to back out of what he had said the more they encouraged nicias to hand over his command and clamored at cleon to go
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.28.4,at last not knowing how to get out of his words he undertook the expedition and came forward and said that he was not afraid of the lacedaemonians but would sail without taking any one from the city with him except the lemnians and imbrians that were at athens with some targeteers that had come up from aenus and four hundred archers from other quarters with these and the soldiers at pylos he would within twenty days either bring the lacedaemonians alive or kill them on the spot
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.28.5,the athenians could not help laughing at his fatuity while sensible men comforted themselves with the reflection that they must gain in either circumstance either they would be rid of cleon which they rather hoped or if disappointed in this expectation would reduce the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.29.1,after he had settled everything in the assembly and the athenians had voted him the command of the expedition he chose as his colleague demosthenes one of the generals at pylos and pushed forward the preparations for his voyage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.29.2,his choice fell upon demosthenes because he heard that he was contemplating a descent on the island the soldiers distressed by the difficulties of the position and rather besieged than besiegers being eager to fight it out while the firing of the island had increased the confidence of the general
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.29.3,he had been at first afraid because the island having never been inhabited was almost entirely covered with wood and without paths thinking this to be in the enemy s favour as he might land with a large force and yet might suffer loss by an attack from an unseen position the mistakes and forces of the enemy the wood would in a great measure conceal from him while every blunder of his own troops would be at once detected and they would be thus able to fall upon him unexpectedly just where they pleased the attack being always in their power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.29.4,if on the other hand he should force them to engage in the thicket the smaller number who knew the country would he thought have the advantage over the larger who were ignorant of it while his own army might be cut off imperceptibly in spite of its numbers as the men would not be able to see where to succor each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.30.1,the aetolian disaster which had been mainly caused by the wood had not a little to do with these reflections
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.30.2,meanwhile one of the soldiers who were compelled by want of room to land on the extremities of the island and take their dinners with outposts fixed to prevent a surprise set fire to a little of the wood without meaning to do so and as it came on to blow soon afterwards almost the whole was consumed before they were aware of it demosthenes was now able for the first time to see how numerous the
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.30.3,lacedaemonians really were having up to this moment been under the impression that they took in provisions for a smaller number he also saw that the athenians thought success important and were anxious about it and that it was now easier to land on the island and accordingly got ready for the attempt sent for troops from the allies in the neighborhood and pushed forward his other preparations
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.30.4,at this moment cleon arrived at pylos with the troops which he had asked for having sent on word to say that he was coming the first step taken by the two generals after their meeting was to send a herald to the camp on the mainland to ask if they were disposed to avoid all risk and to order the men on the island to surrender themselves and their arms to be kept in gentle custody until some general convention should be concluded
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.31.1,on the rejection of this proposition the generals let one day pass and the next embarking all their heavy infantry on board a few ships put out by night and a little before dawn landed on both sides of the island from the open sea and from the harbour being about eight hundred strong and advanced with a run against the first post in the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.31.2,the enemy had distributed his force as follows in this first post there were about thirty heavy infantry the center and most level part where the water was was held by the main body and by epitadas their commander while a small party guarded the very end of the island towards pylos which was precipitous on the seaside and very difficult to attack from the land and where there was also a sort of old fort of stones rudely put together which they thought might be useful to them in case they should be forced to retreat such was their disposition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.32.1,the advanced post thus attacked by the athenians was at once put to the sword the men being scarcely out of bed and still arming the landing having taken them by surprise as they fancied the ships were only sailing as usual to their stations for the night
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.32.2,as soon as day broke the rest of the army landed that is to say all the crews of rather more than seventy ships except the lowest rank of oars with the arms they carried eight hundred archers and as many targeteers the messenian reinforcements and all the other troops on duty round pylos except the garrison on the fort
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.32.3,the tactics of demosthenes had divided them into companies of two hundred more or less and made them occupy the highest points in order to paralyze the enemy by surrounding him on every side and thus leaving him without any tangible adversary exposed to the crossfire of their host plied by those in his rear if he attacked in front and by those on one flank he moved against those on the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.32.4,in short wherever he went he would have the assailants behind him and these lightarmed assailants the most awkward of all arrows darts stones and slings making them formidable at a distance and there being no means of getting at them at close quarters as they could conquer flying and the moment their pursuer turned they were upon him such was the idea that inspired demosthenes in his conception of the descent and presided over its execution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.33.1,meanwhile the main body of the troops in the island that under epitadas seeing their outpost cut off and an army advancing against them serried their ranks and pressed forward to close with the athenian heavy infantry in front of them the light troops being upon their flanks and rear
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.33.2,however they were not able to engage or to profit by their superior skill the light troops keeping them in check on either side with their missiles and the heavy infantry remaining stationary instead of advancing to meet them and although they routed the light troops wherever they ran up and approached too closely yet they retreated fighting being lightly equipped and easily getting the start in their flight from the difficult and rugged nature of the ground in an island hitherto desert over which the lacedaemonians could not pursue them with their heavy armour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.34.1,after this skirmishing had lasted some little while the lacedaemonians became unable to dash out with the same rapidity as before upon the points attacked and the light troops finding that they now fought with less vigor became more confident they could see with their own eyes that they were many times more numerous than the enemy they were now more familiar with his aspect and found him less terrible the result not having justified the apprehensions which they had suffered when they first landed in slavish dismay at the idea of attacking lacedaemonians and accordingly their fear changing to disdain they now rushed all together with loud shouts upon them and pelted them with stones darts and arrows whichever came first to hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.34.2,the shouting accompanying their onset confounded the lacedaemonians unaccustomed to this mode of fighting dust rose from the newlyburnt wood and it was impossible to see in front of one with the arrows and stones flying through clouds of dust from the hands of numerous assailants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.34.3,the lacedaemonians had now to sustain a rude conflict their caps would not keep out the arrows darts had broken off in the armour of the wounded while they themselves were helpless for offence being prevented from using their eyes to see what was before them and unable to hear the words of command for the hubbub raised by the enemy danger encompassed them on every side and there was no hope of any means of defence or safety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.35.1,at last after many had been already wounded in the confined space in which they were fighting they formed in close order and retired on the fort at the end of the island which was not far off and to their friends who held it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.35.2,the moment they gave way the light troops became bolder and pressed upon them shouting louder than ever and killed as many as they came up with in their retreat but most of the lacedaemonian made good their escape to the fort and with the garrison in it ranged themselves all along its whole extent to repulse the enemy wherever it was assailable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.35.3,the athenians pursuing unable to surround and hem them in owing to the strength of the ground attacked them in front and tried to storm the position
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.35.4,for a long time indeed for most of the day both sides held out against all the torments of the battle thirst and sun the one endeavoring to drive the enemy from the high ground the other to maintain himself upon it it being now more easy for the lacedaemonians to defend themselves than before as they could not be surrounded upon the flanks
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.36.1,the struggle began to seem endless when the commander of the messenians came to cleon and demosthenes and told them that they were losing their labour but that if they would give him some archers and light troops to go round on the enemy s rear by a way he would undertake to find he thought he could force the approach
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.36.2,upon receiving what he asked for he started from a point out of sight in order not to be seen by the enemy and creeping on wherever the precipices of the island permitted and where the lacedaemonians trusting to the strength of the ground kept no guard succeeded after the greatest difficulty in getting round without their seeing him and suddenly appeared on the high grounding their rear to the dismay of the surprised enemy and the still greater joy of his expectant friends
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.36.3,the lacedaemonians thus placed between two fires and in the same dilemma to compare small things with great as at thermopylae where the defenders were cut off through the persians getting round by the path being now attacked in front and behind began to give way and overcome by the odds against them and exhausted from want of food retreated the athenians were already masters of the approaches
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.37.1,when cleon and demosthenes perceiving that if the enemy gave way a single step further they would be destroyed by their soldiery put a stop to the battle and held their men back wishing to take the lacedaemonians alive to athens and hoping that their stubbornness might relax on hearing the offer of terms and that they might surrender and yield to the present overwhelming danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.37.2,proclamation was accordingly made to know if they would surrender themselves and their arms to the athenians to be dealt with at their discretion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.38.1,the lacedaemonians hearing this offer most of them lowered their shields and waved their hands to show that they accepted it hostilities now ceased and a parley was held between cleon and demosthenes and styphon son of pharax the other side since epitadas the first of the previous commanders had been killed and hippagretas the next in command left for dead among the slain though still alive and thus the command had devolved upon styphon according to the law in case of anything happening to his superiors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.38.2,styphon and his companions said they wished to send a herald to the lacedaemonians on the mainland to know what they were to do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.38.3,the athenians would not let any of them go but themselves called for heralds from the mainland and after questions had been carried backwards and forwards two or three times the last man that passed over from the lacedaemonians on the continent brought this message the lacedaemonians bid you to decide for yourselves so long as you do nothing dishonourable upon which after consulting together they surrendered themselves and their arms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.38.4,the athenians after guarding them that day and night the next morning set up a trophy in the island and got ready to sail giving their prisoners in batches to be guarded by the captains of the galleys and the lacedaemonians sent a herald and took up their dead
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.38.5,the number of the killed and prisoners taken in the island was as follows four hundred and twenty heavy infantry had passed over three hundred all but eight were taken alive to athens the rest were killed about a hundred and twenty of the prisoners were spartans the athenian loss was small the battle not having been fought at close quarters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.39.1,the blockade in all counting from the fight at sea to the battle in the island had lasted seventytwo days
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.39.2,for twenty of these during the absence of the envoys sent to treat for peace the men had provisions given them for the rest they were fed by the smugglers corn and other victual was found in the island the commander epitadas having kept the men upon half rations
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.39.3,the athenians and peloponnesians now each withdrew their forces from pylos and went home and crazy as cleon s promise was he fulfilled it by bringing the men to athens within the twenty days as he had pledged himself to do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.40.1,nothing that happened in the war surprised the hellenes so much as this it was the opinion that no force or famine could make the lacedaemonians give up their arms but that they would fight on as they could and die with them in their hands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.40.2,indeed people could scarcely believe that those who had surrendered were of the same stuff as the fallen and an athenian ally who some time after insultingly asked one of the prisoners from the island if those that had fallen were men of honor received for answer that the atraktos that is the arrow would be worth a great deal if it could tell men of honor from the rest in allusion to the fact that the killed were those whom the stones and the arrow happened to hit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.41.1,upon the arrival of the men the athenians determined to keep them in prison until the peace and if the peloponnesians invaded their country in the interval to bring them out and put them to death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.41.2,meanwhile the defence of pylos was not forgotten the messenians from naupactus sent to their old country to which pylos formerly belonged some of the likeliest of their number and began a series of incursions into laconia which their common dialect rendered most destructive

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.41.4,the athenians however kept grasping at more and dismissed envoy after envoy without their having effected anything such was the history of the affair of pylos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.42.1,the same summer directly after these events the athenians made an expedition against the territory of corinth with eighty ships and two thousand athenian heavy infantry and two hundred cavalry on board horse transports accompanied by the milesians andrians and carystians from the allies under the command of nicias son of niceratus with two colleagues
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.42.2,putting out to sea they made land at daybreak between chersonese and rheitus at the beach of the country underneath the solygian hill upon which the dorians in old times established themselves and carried on war against the aeolian inhabitants of corinth and where a village now stands called solygia the beach where the fleet came to is about a mile and a half from the village seven miles from corinth and two and a quarter from the isthmus

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.46.5,they gained over some few men on the island by secretly sending friends with instructions to provide them with a boat and to tell them as if for their own sakes that they had best escape as quickly as possible as the athenian generals were going to give them up to the corcyraean people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.47.1,these representations succeeding it was so arranged that the men were caught sailing out in the boat that was provided and the treaty became void accordingly and the whole were given up to the corcyraeans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.47.2,for this result the athenian generals were in a great measure responsible their evident disinclination to sail for sicily and thus to leave to others the honour of conducting the men to athens encouraged the intriguers in their design and seemed to affirm the truth of their representations
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.47.3,the prisoners thus handed over were shut up by the corcyraeans in a large building and afterwards taken out by twenties and led past two lines of heavy infantry one on each side being bound together and beaten and stabbed by the men in the lines whenever any saw pass a personal enemy while men carrying whips went by their side and hastened on the road those that walked too slowly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.48.1,as many as sixty men were taken out and killed in this way without the knowledge of their friends in the building who fancied they were merely being moved from one prison to another at last however some one opened their eyes to the truth upon which they called upon the athenians to kill them themselves if such was their pleasure and refused any longer to go out of the building and said they would do all they could to prevent any one coming in
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.48.2,the corcyraeans not liking themselves to force a passage by the doors got up on the top of the building and breaking through the roof threw down the tiles and let fly arrows at them from which the prisoners sheltered themselves as well as they could
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.48.3,most of their number meanwhile were engaged in dispatching themselves by thrusting into their throats the arrows shot by the enemy and hanging themselves with the cords taken from some beds that happened to be there and with strips made from their clothing adopting in short every possible means of selfdestruction and also falling victims to the missiles of their enemies on the roof night came on while these horrors were enacting and most of it had passed before they were concluded

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.50.3,the athenians after wards sent back artaphernes in a galley to ephesus and ambassadors with him who heard there of the death of king artaxerxes son of xerxes which took place about that time and so returned home

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.52.1,in the first days of the next summer there was an eclipse of the sun at the time of new moon and in the early part of the same month an earthquake

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.52.3,after this they marched against antandrus and took the town by treachery their plan being to free antandrus and the rest of the actaean towns formerly owned by mitylene but now held by the athenians once fortified there they would have every facility for shipbuilding from the vicinity of ida and the consequent abundance of timber and plenty of other supplies and might from this base easily ravage lesbos which was not far off and make themselves masters of the aeolian towns on the continent while these were the schemes of the exiles
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.53.1,the athenians in the same summer made an expedition with sixty ships two thousand heavy infantry a few cavalry and some allied troops from miletus and other parts against cythera under the command of nicias son of niceratus nicostratus son of diotrephes and autocles son of tolmaeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.53.2,cythera is an island lying off laconia opposite malea the inhabitants are lacedaemonians of the class of the perioeci and an officer called the judge of cythera went over to the place annually from sparta a garrison of heavy infantry was also regularly sent there and great attention paid to the island

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.54.1,coming to land here with their armament the athenians with ten ships and two thousand milesian heavy infantry took the town of scandea on the sea and with the rest of their forces landing on the side of the island looking towards malea went against the lower town of cythera where they found all the inhabitants encamped
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.54.2,a battle ensuing the cytherians held their ground for some little while and then turned and fled into the upper town where they soon afterwards capitulated to nicias and his colleagues agreeing to leave their fate to the decision of the athenians their lives only being safe
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.54.3,a correspondence had previously been going on between nicias and certain of the inhabitants which caused the surrender to be effected more speedily and upon terms more advantageous present and future for the cytherians who would otherwise have been expelled by the athenians on account of their being lacedaemonians and their island being so near to laconia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.54.4,after the capitulation the athenians occupied the town of scandea near the harbour and appointing a garrison for cythera sailed to asine helus and most of the places on the sea and making descents and passing the night on shore at such spots as were convenient continued ravaging the country for about seven days
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.55.1,the lacedaemonians seeing the athenians masters of cythera and expecting descents of the kind upon their coasts nowhere opposed them in force but sent garrisons here and there through the country consisting of as many heavy infantry as the points menaced seemed to require and generally stood very much upon the defensive after the severe and unexpected blow that had befallen them in the island the occupation of pylos and cythera and the apparition on every side of a war whose rapidity defied precaution they lived in constant fear of internal revolution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.55.2,and now took the unusual step of raising four hundred horse and a force of archers and became more timid than ever in military matters finding themselves involved in a maritime struggle which their organisation had never contemplated and that against athenians with whom an enterprise unattempted was always looked upon as a success sacrificed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.55.3,besides this their late numerous reverses of fortune coming close one upon another without any reason had thoroughly unnerved them and they were always afraid of a second disaster like that on the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.55.4,and thus scarcely dared to take the field but fancied that they could not stir without a blunder for being new to the experience of adversity they had lost all confidence in themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.56.1,accordingly they now allowed the athenians to ravage their seaboard without making any movement the garrisons in whose neighbourhood the descents were made always thinking their numbers insufficient and sharing the general feeling a single garrison which ventured to resist near cotyrta and aphrodisia struck terror by its charge into the scattered mob of light troops but retreated upon being received by the heavy infantry with the loss of a few men and some arms for which the athenians set up a trophy and then sailed off to cythera
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.56.2,from thence they sailed round to the limeran epidaurus ravaged part of the country and so came to thyrea in the cynurian territory upon the argive and laconian border this district had been given by its lacedaemonian owners to the expelled aeginetans to inhabit in return for their good offices at the time of the earthquake and the rising of the helots and also because although subjects of athens they had always sided with lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.57.1,while the athenians were still at sea the aeginetans evacuated a fort which they were building upon the coast and retreated into the upper town where they lived rather more than a mile from the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.57.2,one of the lacedaemonian district garrisons which was helping them in the work refused to enter here with them at their entreaty thinking it dangerous to shut themselves up within the wall and retiring to the high ground remained quiet not considering themselves a match for the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.57.3,meanwhile the athenians landed and instantly advanced with all their forces and took thyrea the town they burnt pillaging what was in it the aeginetans who were not slain in action they took with them to athens with tantalus son of patrocles their lacedaemonian commander who had been wounded and taken prisoner
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.57.4,they also took with them a few men from cythera whom they thought it safest to remove these the athenians determined to lodge in the islands the rest of the cytherians were to retain their lands and pay four talents tribute the aeginetans captured to be all put to death on account of the old inveterate feud and tantalus to share the imprisonment of the lacedaemonians taken on the island

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.59.1,if i now address you sicilians it is not because my city is the least in sicily or the greatest sufferer by the war but in order to state publicly what appears to me to be the best policy for the whole island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.59.2,that war is an evil is a proposition so familiar to every one that it would be tedious to develop it no one is forced to engage in it by ignorance or kept out of it by fear if he fancies there is anything to be gained by it to the former the gain appears greater than the danger while he latter would rather stand the risk than put up with any immediate sacrifice
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.59.3,but if both should happen to have chosen the wrong moment for acting in this way advice to make peace would not be unserviceable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.59.4,and this if we did but see it is just what we stand most in need of at the present juncture i suppose that no one will dispute that we went to war at first in order to serve our own several interests that we are now in view of the same interests debating how we can make peace and that if we separate without having as we think our rights we shall go to war again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.60.1,and yet as men of sense we ought to see that our separate interests are not alone at stake in the present congress there is also the question whether we have still time to save sicily the whole of which in my opinion is menaced by athenian ambition and we ought to find in the name of that people more imperious arguments for peace than any which i can advance when we see the first power in hellas watching our mistakes with the few ships that she has at present in our waters and under the fair name of alliance speciously seeking to turn to account the natural hostility that exists between us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.60.2,if we go to war and call in to help us a people that are ready enough to carry their arms even where they are not invited and if we injure ourselves at our own expense and at the same time serve as the pioneers of their dominion we may expect when they see us worn out that they will one day come with a larger armament and seek to bring all of us into subjection
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.1,and yet as sensible men if we call in allies and court danger it should be in order to enrich our different countries with new acquisitions and not to ruin what they possess already and we should understand that the intestine discords which are so fatal to communities generally will be equally so to sicily if we its inhabitants absorbed in our local quarrels neglect the common enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.2,these considerations should reconcile individual with individual and city with city and unite us in a common effort to save the whole of sicily nor should any one imagine that the dorians only are enemies of athens while the chalcidian race is secured by its ionian blood
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.3,the attack in question is not inspired by hatred of one of two nationalities but by a desire for the good things in sicily the common property of us all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.4,this is proved by the athenian reception of the chalcidian invitation an ally who has never given them any assistance whatever at once receives from them almost more than the treaty entitles him to
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.5,that the athenians should cherish this ambition and practise this policy is very excusable and i do not blame those who wish to rule but those who are over ready to serve it is just as much in men s nature to rule those who submit to them as it is to resist those who molest them one is not less invariable than the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.6,meanwhile all who see these dangers and refuse to provide for them properly or who have come here without having made up their minds that our first duty is to unite to get rid of the common peril are mistaken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.61.7,the quickest way to be rid of it is to make peace with each other since the athenians menace us not from their own country but from that of those who invited them here in this way instead of war issuing in war peace quietly ends our quarrels and the guests who come hither under fair pretences for bad ends will have good reason for going away without having attained them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.62.1,so far as regards the athenians such are the great advantages proved inherent in a wise policy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.62.2,independently of this in the face of the universal consent that peace is the first of blessings how can we refuse to make it amongst ourselves or do you not think that the good which you have and the ills that you complain of would be better preserved and cured by quiet than by war that peace has its honours and splendours of a less perilous kind not to mention the numerous other blessings that one might dilate on with the not less numerous miseries of war these considerations should teach you not to disregard my words but rather to look in them every one for his own safety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.62.3,if there be any here who feels certain either by right or might to effect his object let not this surprise be to him too severe a disappointment let him remember that many before now have tried to chastise a wrongdoer and failing to punish their enemy have not even saved themselves while many who have trusted in force to gain an advantage instead of gaining anything more have been doomed to lose what they had
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.62.4,vengeance is not necessarily successful because wrong has been done or strength sure because it is confident but the incalculable element in the future exercises the widest influence and is the most treacherous and yet in fact the most useful of all things as it frightens us all equally and thus makes us consider before attacking each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.63.1,let us therefore now allow the undefined fear of this unknown future and the immediate terror of the athenians presence to produce their natural impression and let us consider any failure to carry out the programmes that we may each have sketched out for ourselves as sufficiently accounted for by these obstacles and send away the intruder from the country and if everlasting peace be impossible between us let us at all events make a treaty for as long a term as possible and put off our private differences to another day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.63.2,in fine let us recognize that the adoption of my advice will leave us each citizens of a free state and as such arbiters of our own destiny able to return good or bad offices with equal effect while its rejection will make us dependent on others and thus not only impotent to repel an insult but on the most favourable supposition friends to our direst enemies and at feud with our natural friends

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.64.4,but the foreign invader if we are wise will always find us united against him since the hurt of one is the danger of all and we shall never in future invite into the island either allies or mediators
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.64.5,by so acting we shall at the present moment do for sicily a double service ridding her at once of the athenians and of civil war and in future shall live in freedom at home and be less menaced from abroad

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.65.4,so thoroughly had the present prosperity persuaded the citizens that nothing could withstand them and that they could achieve what was possible and impracticable alike with means ample or inadequate it mattered not the secret of this was their general extraordinary success which made them confuse their strength with their hopes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.66.1,the same summer the megarians in the city pressed by the hostilities of the athenians who invaded their country twice every year with all their forces and harassed by the incursions of their own exiles at pegae who had been expelled in a revolution by the popular party began to ask each other whether it would not be better to receive back their exiles and free the town from one of its two scourges
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.66.2,the friends of the emigrants perceiving the agitation now more openly than before demanded the adoption of this proposition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.66.3,and the leaders of the commons seeing that the sufferings of the times had tired out the constancy of their supporters entered in their alarm into correspondence with the athenian generals hippocrates son of ariphron and demosthenes son of alcisthenes and resolved to betray the town thinking this less dangerous to themselves than the return of the party which they had banished it was accordingly arranged that the athenians should first take the long walls extending for nearly a mile from the city to the port of nisaea to prevent the peloponnesians coming to the rescue from that place where they formed the sole garrison to secure the fidelity of megara and that after this the attempt should be made to put into their hands the upper town which it was thought would then come over with less difficulty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.67.1,the athenians after plans had been arranged between themselves and their correspondents both as to words and actions sailed by night to minoa the island off megara with six hundred heavy infantry under the command of hippocrates and took post in a quarry not far off out of which bricks used to be taken for the walls
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.67.2,while demosthenes the other commander with a detachment of plataean light troops and another of peripoli placed himself in ambush in the precinct of enyalius which was still nearer no one knew of it except those whose business it was to know that night
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.67.3,a little before daybreak the traitors in megara began to act every night for a long time back under pretence of marauding in order to have a means of opening the gates they had been used with the consent of the officer in command to carry by night a sculling boat upon a cart along the ditch to the sea and so to sail out bringing it back again before day upon the cart and taking it within the wall through the gates in order as they pretended to baffle the athenian blockade at minoa there being no boat to be seen in the harbour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.67.4,on the present occasion the cart was already at the gates which had been opened in the usual way for the boat when the athenians with whom this had been concerted saw it and ran at the top of their speed from the ambush in order to reach the gates before they were shut again and while the cart was still there to prevent their being closed their megarian accomplices at the same moment killing the guard at the gates
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.67.5,the first to run in was demosthenes with his plataeans and peripoli just where the trophy now stands and he was no sooner within the gates than the plataeans engaged and defeated the nearest party of peloponnesians who had taken the alarm and come to the rescue and secured the gates for the approaching athenian heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.68.1,after this each of the athenians as fast as they entered went against the wall
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.68.2,a few of the peloponnesian garrison stood their ground at first and tried to repel the assault and some of them were killed but the main body took fright and fled the night attack and the sight of the megarian traitors in arms against them making them think that all megara had gone over to the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.68.3,it so happened also that the athenian herald of his own idea called out and invited any of the megarians that wished to join the athenian ranks and this was no sooner heard by the garrison than they gave way and convinced that they were the victims of a concerted attack took refuge in nisaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.68.4,by daybreak the walls being now taken and the megarians in the city in great agitation the persons who had negotiated with the athenians supported by the rest of the popular party which was privy to the plot said that they ought to open the gates and march out to battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.68.5,it had been concerted between them that the athenians should rush in the moment that the gates were opened while the conspirators were to be distinguished from the rest by being anointed with oil and so to avoid being hurt they could open the gates with more security as four thousand athenian heavy infantry from eleusis and six hundred horse had marched all night according to agreement and were now close at hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.68.6,the conspirators were all ready anointed and at their posts by the gates when one of their accomplices denounced the plot to the opposite party who gathered together and came in a body and roundly said that they must not march out a thing they had never yet ventured on even when in greater force than at present or wantonly compromise the safety of the town and that if what they said was not attended to the battle would have to be fought in megara for the rest they gave no signs of their knowledge of the intrigue but stoutly maintained that their advice was the best and meanwhile kept close by and watched the gates making it impossible for the conspirators to effect their purpose
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.69.1,the athenian generals seeing that some obstacle had arisen and that the capture of the town by force was no longer practicable at once proceeded to invest nisaea thinking that if they could take it before relief arrived the surrender of megara would soon follow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.69.2,iron stonemasons and everything else required quickly coming up from athens the athenians started from the wall which they occupied and from this point built a cross wall looking towards megara down to the sea on either side of nisaea the ditch and the walls being divided among the army stones and bricks taken from the suburb and the fruittrees and timber cut down to make a palisade wherever this seemed necessary the houses also in the suburb with the addition of battlements sometimes entering into the fortification the whole of this day the work continued
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.69.3,and by the afternoon of the next the wall was all but completed when the garrison in nisaea alarmed by the absolute want of provisions which they used to take in for the day from the upper town not anticipating any speedy relief from the peloponnesians and supposing megara to be hostile capitulated to the athenians on condition that they should give up their arms and should each be ransomed for a stipulated sum their lacedaemonian commander and any others of his countrymen in the place being left to the discretion of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.69.4,on these conditions they surrendered and came out and the athenians broke down the long walls at their point of junction with megara took possession of nisaea and went on with their other preparations
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.70.1,just at this time the lacedaemonian brasidas son of tellis happened to be in the neighbourhood of sicyon and corinth getting ready an army for thrace as soon as he heard of the capture of the walls fearing for the peloponnesians in nisaea and the safety of megara he sent to the boeotians to meet him as quickly as possible at tripodiscus a village so called of the megarid under mount geraneia and went himself with two thousand seven hundred corinthian heavy infantry four hundred phliasians six hundred sicyonians and such troops of his own as he had already levied expecting to find nisaea not yet taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.70.2,hearing of its fall he had marched out by night to tripodiscus he took three hundred picked men from the army without waiting till his coming should be known and came up to megara unobserved by the athenians who were down by the sea ostensibly and really if possible to attempt nisaea but above all to get into megara and secure the town he accordingly invited the townspeople to admit his party saying that he had hopes of recovering nisaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.71.1,however one of the megarian factions feared that he might expel them and restore the exiles the other that the commons apprehensive of this very danger might set upon them and the city be thus destroyed by a battle within its gates under the eyes of the ambushed athenians he was accordingly refused admittance both parties electing to remain quiet and await the event
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.71.2,each expecting a battle between the athenians and the relieving army and thinking it safer to see their friends victorious before declaring in their favour unable to carry his point brasidas went back to the rest of the army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.72.1,at daybreak the boeotians joined him having determined to relieve megara whose danger they considered their own even before hearing from brasidas they were already in full force at plataea when his messenger arrived to add spurs to their resolution and they at once sent on to him two thousand two hundred heavy infantry and six hundred horse returning home with the main body
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.72.2,the whole army thus assembled numbered six thousand heavy infantry the athenian heavy infantry were drawn up by nisaea and the sea but the light troops being scattered over the plain were attacked by the boeotian horse and driven to the sea being taken entirely by surprise as on previous occasions no relief had ever come to the megarians from any quarter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.72.3,here the boeotians were in their turn charged and engaged by the athenian horse and a cavalry action ensued which lasted a long time and in which both parties claimed the victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.72.4,the athenians killed and stripped the leader of the boeotian horse and some few of his comrades who had charged right up to nisaea and remaining masters of the bodies gave them back under truce and set up a trophy but regarding the action as a whole the forces separated without either side having gained a decisive advantage the boeotians returning to their army and the athenians to nisaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.73.1,after this brasidas and the army came nearer to the sea and to megara and taking up a convenient position remained quiet in order of battle expecting to be attacked by the athenians and knowing that the megarians were waiting to see which would be the victor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.73.2,this attitude seemed to present two advantages without taking the offensive or willingly provoking the hazards of a battle they openly showed their readiness to fight and thus without bearing the burden of the day would fairly reap its honours while at the same time they effectually served their interests at megara
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.73.3,for if they had failed to show themselves they would not have had a chance but would have certainly been considered vanquished and have lost the town as it was the athenians might possibly not be inclined to accept their challenge and their object would be attained without fighting
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.73.4,and so it turned out the athenians formed outside the long walls and the enemy not attacking there remained motionless their generals having decided that the risk was too unequal in fact most of their objects had been already attained and they would have to begin a battle against superior numbers and if victorious could only gain megara while a defeat would destroy the flower of their heavy soldiery for the enemy it was different as even the states actually represented in his army risked each only a part of its entire force he might well be more audacious accordingly after waiting for some time without either side attacking the athenians withdrew to nisaea and the peloponnesians after them to the point from which they had set out the friends of the megarian exiles now threw aside their hesitation and opened the gates to brasidas and the commanders from the different states looking upon him as the victor and upon the athenians as having declined the battle and receiving them into the town proceeded to discuss matters with them the party in correspondence with the athenians being paralyzed by the turn things had taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.74.1,afterwards brasidas let the allies go home and himself went back to corinth to prepare for his expedition to thrace his original destination
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.74.2,the athenians also returning home the megarians in the city most implicated in the athenian negotiation knowing that they had been detected presently disappeared while the rest conferred with the friends of the exiles and restored the party at pegae after binding them under solemn oaths to take no vengeance for the past and only to consult the real interests of the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.74.3,however as soon as they were in office they held a review of the heavy infantry and separating the battalions picked out about a hundred of their enemies and of those who were thought to be most involved in the correspondence with the athenians brought them before the people and compelling the vote to be given openly had them condemned and executed and established a close oligarchy in the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.74.4,a revolution which lasted a very long while although effected by a very few partisans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.75.1,the same summer the mitylenians were about to fortify antandrus as they had intended when demodocus and aristides the commanders of the athenian squadron engaged in levying subsidies heard on the hellespont of what was being done to the place lamachus their colleague having sailed with ten ships into the pontus and conceived fears of its becoming a second anaia the place in which the samian exiles had established themselves to annoy samos helping the peloponnesians by sending pilots to their navy and keeping the city in agitation and receiving all its outlaws they accordingly got together a force from the allies and set sail defeated in battle the troops that met them from antandrus and retook the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.75.2,not long after lamachus who had sailed into the pontus lost his ships at anchor in the river calex in the territory of heraclea rain having fallen in the interior and the flood coming suddenly down upon them and himself and his troops passed by land through the bithynian thracians on the asiatic side and arrived at chalcedon the megarian colony at the mouth of the pontus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.76.1,the same summer the athenian general demosthenes arrived at naupactus with forty ships immediately after the return from the megarid
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.76.2,hippocrates and himself had had overtures made to them by certain men in the cities in boeotia who wished to change the constitution and introduce a democracy as at athens ptoeodorus a theban exile being the chief mover in this intrigue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.76.3,the seaport town of siphae in the bay of crisae in the thespian territory was to be betrayed to them by one party chaeronea a dependency of what was formerly called the minyan now the boeotian orchomenus to be put into their hands by another from that town whose exiles were very active in the business hiring men in peloponnese some phocians also were in the plot chaeronea being the frontier town of boeotia and close to phanotis in phocis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.76.4,meanwhile the athenians were to seize delium the sanctuary of apollo in the territory of tanagra looking towards euboea and all these events were to take place simultaneously upon a day appointed in order that the boeotians might be unable to unite to oppose them at delium being everywhere detained by disturbances at home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.76.5,should the enterprise succeed and delium be fortified its authors confidently expected that even if no revolution should immediately follow in boeotia yet with these places in their hands and the country being harassed by incursions and a refuge in each instance near for the partisans engaged in them things would not remain as they were but that the rebels being supported by the athenians and the forces of the oligarchs divided it would be possible after a while to settle matters according to their wishes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.77.1,such was the plot in contemplation hippocrates with a force raised at home awaited the proper moment to take the field against the boeotians while he sent on demosthenes with the forty ships above mentioned to naupactus to raise in those parts an army of acarnanians and of the other allies and sail and receive siphae from the conspirators a day having been agreed on for the simultaneous execution of both these operations
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.77.2,demosthenes on his arrival found oeniadae already compelled by the united acarnanians to join the athenian confederacy and himself raising all the allies in those countries marched against and subdued salynthius and the agraeans after which he devoted himself to the preparations necessary to enable him to be at siphae by the time appointed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.78.1,about the same time in the summer brasidas set out on his march for the thracian places with seventeen hundred heavy infantry and arriving at heraclea in trachis from thence sent on a messenger to his friends at pharsalus to ask them to conduct himself and his army through the country accordingly there came to melitia in achaia panaerus dorus hippolochidas torylaus and strophacus the chalcidian proxenus under whose escort he resumed his march
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.78.2,being accompanied also by other thessalians among whom was niconidas from larissa a friend of perdiccas it was never very easy to traverse thessaly without an escort and throughout all hellas for an armed force to pass without leave through a neighbour s country was a delicate step to take besides this the thessalian people had always sympathized with the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.78.3,indeed if instead of the customary close oligarchy there had been a constitutional government in thessaly he would never have been able to proceed since even as it was he was met on his march at the river enipeus by certain of the opposite party who forbade his further progress and complained of his making the attempt without the consent of the nation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.78.4,to this his escort answered that they had no intention of taking him through against their will they were only friends in attendance on an unexpected victor brasidas himself added that he came as a friend to thessaly and its inhabitants his arms not being directed against them but against the athenians with whom he was at war and that although he knew of no quarrel between the thessalians and lacedaemonians to prevent the two nations having access to each other s territory he neither would nor could proceed against their wishes he could only beg them not to stop him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.78.5,with this answer they went away and he took the advice of his escort and pushed on without halting before a greater force might gather to prevent him thus in the day that he set out from melitia he performed the whole distance to pharsalus and encamped on the river apidanus and so to phacium and from thence to perrhaebia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.78.6,here his thessalian escort went back and the perrhaebians who are subjects of thessaly set him down at dium in the dominions of perdiccas a macedonian town under mount olympus looking towards thessaly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.79.1,in this way brasidas hurried through thessaly before any one could be got ready to stop him and reached perdiccas and chalcidice
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.79.2,the departure of the army from peloponnese had been procured by the thracian towns in revolt against athens and by perdiccus alarmed at the successes of the athenians the chalcidians thought that they would be the first objects of an athenian expedition not that the neighbouring towns which had not yet revolted did not also secretly join in the invitation and perdiccas also had his apprehensions on account of his old quarrels with the athenians although not openly at war with them and above all wished to reduce arrhabaeus king of the lyncestians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.79.3,it had been less difficult for them to get an army to leave peloponnese because of the ill fortune of the lacedaemonians at the present moment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.80.1,the attacks of the athenians upon peloponnese and in particular upon laconia might it was hoped be diverted most effectually by annoying them in return and by sending an army to their allies especially as they were willing to maintain it and asked for it to aid them in revolting
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.80.2,the lacedaemonians were also glad to have an excuse for sending some of the helots out of the country for fear that the present aspect of affairs and the occupation of pylos might encourage them to move
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.80.3,indeed fear of their numbers and obstinacy even persuaded the lacedaemonians to the action which i shall now relate their policy at all times having been governed by the necessity of taking precautions against them the helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against the enemy in order that they might receive their freedom the object being to test them as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.80.4,as many as two thousand were selected accordingly who crowned themselves and went round the temples rejoicing in their new freedom the spartans however soon afterwards did away with them and no one ever knew how each of them perished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.80.5,the spartans now therefore gladly sent seven hundred as heavy infantry with brasidas who recruited the rest of his force by means of money in peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.81.1,brasidas himself was sent out by the lacedaemonians mainly at his own desire although the chalcidians also were eager to have a man so thorough as he had shown himself whenever there was anything to be done at sparta and whose after service abroad proved of the utmost use to his country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.81.2,at the present moment his just and moderate conduct towards the towns generally succeeded in procuring their revolt besides the places which he managed to take by treachery and thus when the lacedaemonians desired to treat as they ultimately did they had places to offer in exchange and the burden of war meanwhile shifted from peloponnese later on in the war after the events in sicily the present valour and conduct of brasidas known by experience to some by hearsay to others was what mainly created in the allies of athens a feeling for the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.81.3,he was the first who went out and showed himself so good a man at all points as to leave behind him the conviction that the rest were like him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.82.1,meanwhile his arrival in the thracian country no sooner became known to the athenians than they declared war against perdiccas whom they regarded as the author of the expedition and kept a closer watch on their allies in that quarter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.83.1,upon the arrival of brasidas and his army perdiccas immediately started with them and with his own forces against arrhabaeus son of bromerus king of the lyncestian macedonians his neighbour with whom he had a quarrel and whom he wished to subdue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.83.2,however when he arrived with his army and brasidas at the pass leading into lyncus brasidas told him that before commencing hostilities he wished to go and try to persuade arrhabaeus to become the ally of lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.83.3,this latter having already made overtures intimating his willingness to make brasidas arbitrator between them and the chalcidian envoys accompanying him having warned him not to remove the apprehensions of perdiccas in order to insure his greater zeal in their cause
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.83.4,besides the envoys of perdiccas had talked at lacedaemon about his bringing many of the places round him into alliance with them and thus brasidas thought he might take a larger view of the question of arrhabaeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.83.5,perdiccas however retorted that he had not brought him with him to arbitrate in their quarrel but to put down the enemies whom he might point out to him and that while he perdiccas maintained half his army it was a breach of faith for brasidas to parley with arrhabaeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.83.6,nevertheless brasidas disregarded the wishes of perdiccas and held the parley in spite of him and suffered himself to be persuaded to lead off the army without invading the country of arrhabaeus after which perdiccas holding that faith had not been kept with him contributed only a third instead of half of the support of the army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.84.1,the same summer without loss of time brasidas marched with the chalcidians against acanthus a colony of the andrians a little before vintage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.84.2,the inhabitants were divided into two parties on the question of receiving him those who had joined the chalcidians in inviting him and the popular party however fear for their fruit which was still out enabled brasidas to persuade the multitude to admit him alone and to hear what he had to say before making a decision and he was admitted accordingly and appeared before the people and not being a bad speaker for a lacedaemonian addressed them as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.85.1,acanthians the lacedaemonians have sent out me and my army to make good the reason that we gave for the war when we began it viz that we were going to war with the athenians in order to free hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.85.2,our delay in coming has been caused by mistaken expectations as to the war at home which led us to hope by our own unassisted efforts and without your risking anything to effect the speedy downfall of the athenians and you must not blame us for this as we are now come the moment that we were able prepared with your aid to do our best to subdue them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.85.3,meanwhile i am astonished at finding your gates shut against me and at not meeting with a better welcome
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.85.4,we lacedaemonians thought of you as allies eager to have us to whom we should come in spirit even before we were with you in body and in this expectation undertook all the risks of a march of many days through a strange country so far did our zeal carry us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.85.5,it will be a terrible thing if after this you have other intentions and mean to stand in the way of your own and hellenic freedom
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.85.6,it is not merely that you oppose me yourselves but wherever i may go people will be less inclined to join me on the score that you to whom i first came an important town like acanthus and prudent men like the acanthians refused to admit me i shall have nothing to prove that the reason which i advance is the true one it will be said either that there is something unfair in the freedom which i offer or that i am here in insufficient force and unable to protect you against an attack from athens

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.90.2,a trench was dug all round the temple and the consecrated ground and the earth thrown up from the excavation was made to do duty as a wall in which stakes were also planted the vines round the sanctuary being cut down and thrown in together with stones and bricks pulled down from the houses near every means in short being used to run up the rampart wooden towers were also erected where they were wanted and where there was no part of the temple buildings left standing as on the side where the gallery once existing had fallen in

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.91.1,during the days thus employed the boeotians were mustering at tanagra and by the time that they had come in from all the towns found the athenians already on their way home the rest of the eleven boeotarchs were against giving battle as the enemy was no longer in boeotia the athenians being just over the oropian border when they halted but pagondas son of aeolidas one of the boeotarchs of thebes arianthides son of lysimachidas being the other and then commanderinchief thought it best to hazard a battle he accordingly called the men to him company after company to prevent their all leaving their arms at once and urged them to attack the athenians and stand the issue of a battle speaking as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.92.1,boeotians the idea that we ought not to give battle to the athenians unless we came up with them in boeotia is one which should never have entered into the head of any of us your generals it was to annoy boeotia that they crossed the frontier and built a fort in our country and they are therefore i imagine our enemies wherever we may come up with them and from wheresoever they may have come to act as enemies do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.92.2,and if any one has taken up with the idea in question for reasons of safety it is high time for him to change his mind the party attacked whose own country is in danger can scarcely discuss what is prudent with the calmness of men who are in full enjoyment of what they have got and are thinking of attacking a neighbour in order to get more

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.92.4,as between neighbours generally freedom means simply a determination to hold ones own and with neighbours like these who are trying to enslave near and far alike there is nothing for it but to fight it out to the last look at the condition of the euboeans and of most of the rest of hellas and be convinced that others have to fight with their neighbours for this frontier or that but that for us conquest means one frontier for the whole country about which no dispute can be made for they will simply come and take by force what we have

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.92.6,the athenians have shown us this themselves the defeat which we inflicted upon them at coronea at the time when our quarrels had allowed them to occupy the country has given great security to boeotia until the present day

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.93.1,by these arguments pagondas persuaded the boeotians to attack the athenians and quickly breaking up his camp led his army forward it being now late in the day on nearing the enemy he halted in a position where a hill intervening prevented the two armies from seeing each other and then formed and prepared for action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.93.2,meanwhile hippocrates at delium informed of the approach of the boeotians sent orders to his troops to throw themselves into line and himself joined them not long afterwards leaving about three hundred horse behind him at delium at once to guard the place in case of attack and to watch their opportunity and fall upon the boeotians during the battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.93.3,the boeotians placed a detachment to deal with these and when everything was arranged to their satisfaction appeared over the hill and halted in the order which they had determined on to the number of seven thousand heavy infantry more than ten thousand light troops one thousand horse and five hundred targeteers

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.94.2,the armies being now in line and upon the point of engaging hippocrates the general passed along the athenian ranks and encouraged them as follows

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.1,hippocrates had got half through the army with his exhortation when the boeotians after a few more hasty words from pagondas struck up the paean and came against them from the hill the athenians advancing to meet them and closing at a run
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.2,the extreme wing of neither army came into action one like the other being stopped by the watercourses in the way the rest engaged with the utmost obstinacy shield against shield
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.3,the boeotian left as far as the center was worsted by the athenians the thespians in that part of the field suffered most severely the troops alongside them having given way they were surrounded in a narrow space and cut down fighting hand to hand some of the athenians also fell into confusion in surrounding the enemy and mistook and so killed each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.4,in this part of the field the boeotians were beaten and retreated upon the troops still fighting but the right where the thebans were got the better of the athenians and shoved them further and further back though gradually at first
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.5,it so happened also that pagondas seeing the distress of his left had sent two squadrons of horse where they could not be seen round the hill and their sudden appearance struck a panic into the victorious wing of the athenians who thought that it was another army coming against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.6,at length in both parts of the field disturbed by this panic and with their line broken by the advancing thebans the whole athenian army took to flight

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.96.9,the next day the troops at oropus and delium returned home by sea after leaving a garrison in the latter place which they continued to hold notwithstanding the defeat
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.97.1,the boeotians set up a trophy took up their own dead and stripped those of the enemy and leaving a guard over them retired to tanagra there to take measures for attacking delium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.97.2,meanwhile a herald came from the athenians to ask for the dead but was met and turned back by a boeotian herald who told him that he would effect nothing until the return of himself the boeotian herald and who then went on to the athenians and told them on the part of the boeotians that they had done wrong in transgressing the law of the hellenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.97.3,of what use was the universal custom protecting the temples in an invaded country if the athenians were to fortify delium and live there acting exactly as if they were on unconsecrated ground and drawing and using for their purposes the water which they the boeotians never touched except for sacred uses
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.97.4,accordingly for the god as well as for themselves in the name of the deities concerned and of apollo the boeotians invited them first to evacuate the temple if they wished to take up the dead that belonged to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.98.1,after these words from the herald the athenians sent their own herald to the boeotians to say that they had not done any wrong to the temple and for the future would do it no more harm than they could help not having occupied it originally in any such design but to defend themselves from it against those who were really wronging them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.98.2,the law of the hellenes was that conquest of a country whether more or less extensive carried with it possession of the temples in that country with the obligation to keep up the usual ceremonies at least as far as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.98.3,the boeotians and most other people who had turned out the owners of a country and put themselves in their places by force now held as of right the temples which they originally entered as usurpers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.98.4,if the athenians could have conquered more of boeotia this would have been the case with them as things stood the piece of it which they had got they should treat as their own and not quit unless obliged

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.98.7,in short which were most impious the boeotians who wished to barter dead bodies for holy places or the athenians who refused to give up holy places to obtain what was theirs by right
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.98.8,the condition of evacuating boeotia must therefore be withdrawn they were no longer in boeotia they stood where they stood by the right of the sword all that the boeotians had to do was to tell them to take up their dead under a truce according to the national custom
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.99.1,the boeotians replied that if they were in boeotia they must evacuate that country before taking up their dead if they were in their own territory they could do as they pleased for they knew that although the oropid where the bodies as it chanced were lying the battle having been fought on the borders was subject to athens yet the athenians could not get them without their leave besides why should they grant a truce for athenian ground and what could be fairer than to tell them to evacuate boeotia if they wished to get what they asked the athenian herald accordingly returned with this answer without having accomplished his object
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.100.1,meanwhile the boeotians at once sent for darters and slingers from the malian gulf and with two thousand corinthian heavy infantry who had joined them after the battle the peloponnesian garrison which had evacuated nisaea and some megarians with them marched against delium and attacked the fort and after divers efforts finally succeeded in taking it by an engine of the following description
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.100.2,they sawed in two and scooped out a great beam from end to end and fitting it nicely together again like a pipe hung by chains a cauldron at one extremity with which communicated an iron tube projecting from the beam which was itself in great part plated with iron
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.100.3,this they brought up from a distance upon carts to the part of the wall principally composed of vines and timber and when it was near inserted huge bellows into their end of the beam and blew with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.100.4,the blast passing closely confined into the cauldron which was filled with lighted coals sulphur and pitch made a great blaze and set fire to the wall which soon became untenable for its defenders who left it and fled and in this way the fort was taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.100.5,of the garrison some were killed and two hundred made prisoners most of the rest got on board their ships and returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.101.1,soon after the fall of delium which took place seventeen days after the battle the athenian herald without knowing what had happened came again for the dead which were now restored by the boeotians who no longer answered as at first
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.101.2,not quite five hundred boeotians fell in the battle and nearly one thousand athenians including hippocrates the general besides a great number of light troops and camp followers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.101.3,soon after this battle demosthenes after the failure of his voyage to siphae and of the plot on the town availed himself of the acarnanian and agraean troops and of the four hundred athenian heavy infantry which he had on board to make a descent on the sicyonian coast

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.101.5,about the same time with the affair of delium took place the death of sitalces king of the odrysians who was defeated in battle in a campaign against the tribalii seuthes son of sparadocus his nephew succeeding to the kingdom of the odrysians and of the rest of thrace ruled by sitalces
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.102.1,the same winter brasidas with his allies in the thracian places marched against amphipolis the athenian colony on the river strymon

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.102.3,twentynine years after the athenians returned hagnon son of nicias being sent out as a leader of the colony and drove out the edonians and founded a town on the spot formerly called enneahodoi or nine ways the base from which they started was eion their commercial seaport at the mouth of the river not more than three miles from the present town which hagnon named amphipolis because the strymon flows round it on two sides and he built it so as to be conspicuous from the sea and land alike running a long wall across from river to river to complete the circumference
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.103.1,brasidas now marched against this town starting from arne in chalcidice arriving about dusk at aulon and bromiscus where the lake of bolbe runs into the sea he supped there and went on during the night
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.103.2,the weather was stormy and it was snowing a little which encouraged him to hurry on in order if possible to take every one at amphipolis by surprise except the party who were to betray it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.103.3,the plot was carried on by some natives of argilus an andrian colony residing in amphipolis where they had also other accomplices gained over by perdiccas or the chalcidians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.103.4,but the most active in the matter were the inhabitants of argilus itself which is close by who had always been suspected by the athenians and had had designs on the place these men now saw their opportunity arrive with brasidas and having for some time been in correspondence with their countrymen in amphipolis for the betrayal of the town at once received him into argilus and revolted from the athenians and that same night took him on to the bridge over the river
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.103.5,where he found only a small guard to oppose him the town being at some distance from the passage and the walls not reaching down to it as at present this guard he easily drove in partly through there being treason in their ranks partly from the stormy state of the weather and the suddenness of his attack and so got across the bridge and immediately became master of all the property outside the amphipolitans having houses all over the quarter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.104.1,the passage of brasidas was a complete surprise to the people in the town and the capture of many of those outside and the flight of the rest within the wall combined to produce great confusion among the citizens especially as they did not trust one another
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.104.2,it is even said that if brasidas instead of stopping to pillage had advanced straight against the town he would probably have taken it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.104.3,in fact however he established himself where he was and overran the country outside and for the present remained inactive vainly awaiting a demonstration on the part of his friends within
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.104.4,meanwhile the party opposed to the traitors proved numerous enough to prevent the gates being immediately thrown open and in concert with eucles the general who had come from athens to defend the place sent to the other commander in thrace thucydides son of olorus the author of this history who was at the isle of thasos a parian colony half a day s sail from amphipolis to tell him to come to their relief
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.104.5,on receipt of this message he at once set sail with seven ships which he had with him in order if possible to reach amphipolis in time to prevent its capitulation or in any case to save eion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.105.1,meanwhile brasidas afraid of succors arriving by sea from thasos and learning that thucydides possessed the right of working the gold mines in that part of thrace and had thus great influence with the inhabitants of the continent hastened to gain the town if possible before the people of amphipolis should be encouraged by his arrival to hope that he could save them by getting together a force of allies from the sea and from thrace and so refuse to surrender

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.106.1,the bulk of the inhabitants upon hearing this began to change their minds especially as only a small number of the citizens were athenians the majority having come from different quarters and many of the prisoners outside had relations within the walls they found the proclamation a fair one in comparison of what their fear had suggested the athenians being glad to go out as they thought they ran more risk than the rest and further did not expect any speedy relief and the multitude generally being content at being left in possession of their civic rights and at such an unexpected reprieve from danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.106.2,the partisans of brasidas now openly advocated this course seeing that the feeling of the people had changed and that they no longer gave ear to the athenian general present and thus the surrender was made and brasidas was admitted by them on the terms of his proclamation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.106.3,in this way they gave up the city and late in the same day thucydides and his ships entered the harbour of eion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.106.4,brasidas having just got hold of amphipolis and having been within a night of taking eion had the ships been less prompt in relieving it in the morning it would have been his
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.107.1,after this thucydides put all in order at eion to secure it against any present or future attack of brasidas and received such as had elected to come there from the interior according to the terms agreed on
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.107.2,meanwhile brasidas suddenly sailed with a number of boats down the river to eion to see if he could not seize the point running out from the wall and so command the entrance at the same time he attempted it by land but was beaten off on both sides and had to content himself with arranging matters at amphipolis and in the neighbourhood

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.1,the news that amphipolis was in the hands of the enemy caused great alarm at athens not only was the town valuable for the timber it afforded for shipbuilding and the money that it brought in but also although the escort of the thessalians gave the lacedaemonians a means of reaching the allies of athens as far as the strymon yet as long as they were not masters of the bridge but were watched on the side of eion by the athenian galleys and on the land side impeded by a large and extensive lake formed by the waters of the river it was impossible for them to go any further now on the contrary the path seemed open there was also the fear of the allies revolting
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.2,owing to the moderation displayed by brasidas in all his conduct and to the declarations which he was everywhere making that he was sent out to free hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.3,the towns subject to the athenians hearing of the capture of amphipolis and of the terms accorded to it and of the gentleness of brasidas felt most strongly encouraged to change their condition and sent secret messages to him begging him to come on to them each wishing to be the first to revolt
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.4,indeed there seemed to be no danger in so doing their mistake in their estimate of the athenian power was as great as that power afterwards turned out to be and their judgment was based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound prevision for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.5,besides the late severe blow which the athenians had met with in boeotia joined to the seductive though untrue statements of brasidas about the athenians not having ventured to engage his single army at nisaea made the allies confident and caused them to believe that no athenian force would be sent against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.6,above all the wish to do what was agreeable at the moment and the likelihood that they should find the lacedaemonians full of zeal at starting made them eager to venture observing this the athenians sent garrisons to the different towns as far as was possible at such short notice and in winter while brasidas sent despatches to lacedaemon asking for reinforcements and himself made preparations for building galleys in the strymon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.108.7,the lacedaemonians however did not send him any partly through envy on the part of their chief men partly because they were more bent on recovering the prisoners of the island and ending the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.109.1,the same winter the megarians took and razed to the foundations the long walls which had been occupied by the athenians and brasidas after the capture of amphipolis marched with his allies against acte

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.110.1,upon their not submitting he at once marched against torone in chalcidice which was held by an athenian garrison having been invited by a few persons who were prepared to hand over the town arriving in the dark a little before daybreak he sat down with his army near the temple of the dioscuri rather more than a quarter of a mile from the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.110.2,the rest of the town of torone and the athenians in garrison did not perceive his approach but his partisans knowing that he was coming a few of them had secretly gone out to meet him were on the watch for his arrival and were no sooner aware of it than they took in to them seven lightarmed men with daggers who alone of twenty men ordered on this service dared to enter commanded by lysistratus an olynthian these passed through the sea wall and without being seen went up and put to the sword the garrison of the highest post in the town which stands on a hill and broke open the postern on the side of canastraeum
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.111.1,brasidas meanwhile came a little nearer and then halted with his main body sending on one hundred targeteers to be ready to rush in first the moment that a gate should be thrown open and the beacon lighted as agreed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.111.2,after some time passed in waiting and wondering at the delay the targeteers by degrees got up close to the town the toronaeans inside at work with the party that had entered had by this time broken down the postern and opened the gates leading to the marketplace by cutting through the bar and first brought some men round and let them in by the postern in order to strike a panic into the surprised townsmen by suddenly attacking them from behind and on both sides at once after which they raised the firesignal as had been agreed and took in by the market gates the rest of the targeteers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.112.1,brasidas seeing the signal told the troops to rise and dashed forward amid the loud hurrahs of his men which carried dismay among the astonished townspeople

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.113.1,the capture of the town was effected before the great body of the toronaeans had recovered from their surprise and confusion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.113.2,but the conspirators and the citizens of their party at once joined the invaders about fifty of the athenian heavy infantry happened to be sleeping in the marketplace when the alarm reached them a few of these were killed fighting the rest escaped some by land others to the two ships on the station and took refuge in lecythus a fort garrisoned by their own men in the corner of the town running out into the sea and cut off by a narrow isthmus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.113.3,where they were joined by the toronaeans of their party
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.114.1,day now arrived and the town being secured brasidas made a proclamation to the toronaeans who had taken refuge with the athenians to come out as many as chose to their homes without fearing for their rights or persons and sent a herald to invite the athenians to accept a truce and to evacuate lecythus with their property as being chalcidian ground
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.114.2,the athenians refused this offer but asked for a truce for a day to take up their dead brasidas granted it for two days which he employed in fortifying the houses near and the athenians in doing the same to their positions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.114.3,meanwhile he called a meeting of the toronaeans and said very much what he had said at acanthus namely that they must not look upon those who had negotiated with him for the capture of the town as bad men or as traitors as they had not acted as they had done from corrupt motives or in order to enslave the city but for the good and freedom of torone nor again must those who had not shared in the enterprise fancy that they would not equally reap its fruits as he had not come to destroy either city or individual
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.114.4,this was the reason of his proclamation to those that had fled for refuge to the athenians he thought none the worse of them for their friendship for the athenians he believed that they had only to make trial of the lacedaemonians to like them as well or even much better as acting much more justly it was for want of such a trial that they were now afraid of them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.114.5,meanwhile he warned all of them to prepare to be staunch allies and for being held responsible for all faults in future for the past they had not wronged the lacedaemonians but had been wronged by others who were too strong for them and any opposition that they might have offered him could be excused
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.115.1,having encouraged them with this address as soon as the truce expired he made his attack upon lecythus the athenians defending themselves from a poor wall and from some houses with parapets
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.115.2,one day they beat him off the next the enemy were preparing to bring up an engine against them from which they meant to throw fire upon the wooden defences and the troops were already coming up to the point where they fancied they could best bring up the engine and where the place was most assailable meanwhile the athenians put a wooden tower upon a house opposite and carried up a quantity of jars and casks of water and big stones and a large number of men also climbed up
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.115.3,the house thus laden too heavily suddenly broke down with a loud crash at which the men who were near and saw it were more vexed than frightened but those not so near and still more those furthest off thought that the place was already taken at that point and fled in haste to the sea and the ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.116.1,brasidas perceiving that they were deserting the parapet and seeing what was going on dashed forward with his troops and immediately took the fort and put to the sword all whom he found in it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.116.2,in this way the place was evacuated by the athenians who went across in their boats and ships to pallene now there is a temple of athena in lecythus and brasidas had proclaimed in the moment of making the assault that he would give thirty silver minae to the man first on the wall being now of opinion that the capture was scarcely due to human means he gave the thirty minae to the goddess for her temple and razed and cleared lecythus and made the whole of it consecrated ground
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.116.3,the rest of the winter he spent in settling the places in his hands and in making designs upon the rest and with the expiration of the winter the eighth year of this war ended
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.117.1,in the spring of the summer following the lacedaemonians and athenians made an armistice for a year the athenians thinking that they would thus have full leisure to take their precautions before brasidas could procure the revolt of any more of their towns and might also if it suited them conclude a general peace the lacedaemonians divining the actual fears of the athenians and thinking that after once tasting a respite from trouble and misery they would be more disposed to consent to a reconciliation and to give back the prisoners and make a treaty for the longer period
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.117.2,the great idea of the lacedaemonians was to get back their men while brasidas good fortune lasted further successes might make the struggle a less unequal one in chalcidice but would leave them still deprived of their men and even in chalcidice not more than a match for the athenians and by no means certain of victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.117.3,an armistice was accordingly concluded by lacedaemon and her allies upon the terms following

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.119.3,such was the armistice and during the whole of it conferences went on on the subject of a pacification
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.120.1,in the days in which they were going backwards and forwards to these conferences scione a town in pallene revolted from athens and went over to brasidas the scionaeans say that they are pallenians from peloponnese and that their first founders on their voyage from troy were carried in to this spot by the storm which the achaeans were caught in and there settled
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.120.2,the scionaeans had no sooner revolted than brasidas crossed over by night to scione with a friendly galley ahead and himself in a small boat some way behind his idea being that if he fell in with a vessel larger than the boat he would have the galley to defend him while a ship that was a match for the galley would probably neglect the small vessel to attack the large one and thus leave him time to escape
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.120.3,his passage effected he called a meeting of the scionaeans and spoke to the same effect as at acanthus and torone adding that they merited the utmost commendation in that in spite of pallene within the isthmus being cut off by the athenian occupation of potidaea and of their own practically insular position they had of their own free will gone forward to meet their liberty instead of timorously waiting until they had been by force compelled to their own manifest good this was a sign that they would valiantly undergo any trial however great and if he should order affairs as he intended he should count them among the truest and sincerest friends of the lacedaemonians and would in every other way honour them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.121.1,the scionaeans were elated by his language and even those who had at first disapproved of what was being done catching the general confidence they determined on a vigorous conduct of the war and welcomed brasidas with all possible honours publicly crowning him with a crown of gold as the liberator of hellas while private persons crowded round him and decked him with garlands as though he had been an athlete
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.121.2,meanwhile brasidas left them a small garrison for the present and crossed back again and not long afterwards sent over a larger force intending with the help of the scionaeans to attempt mende and potidaea before the athenians should arrive scione he felt being too like an island for them not to relieve it he had besides intelligence in the above towns about their betrayal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.122.1,in the midst of his designs upon the towns in question a galley arrived with the commissioners carrying round the news of the armistice aristonymus for the athenians and athenaeus for the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.122.2,the troops now crossed back to torone and the commissioners gave brasidas notice of the convention all the lacedaemonian allies in thrace accepted what had been done
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.122.3,and aristonymus made no difficulty about the rest but finding on counting the days that the scionaeans had revolted after the date of the convention refused to include them in it to this brasidas earnestly objected asserting that the revolt took place before and would not give up the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.122.4,upon aristonymus reporting the case to athens the people at once prepared to send an expedition to scione upon this envoys arrived from lacedaemon alleging that this would be a breach of the truce and laying claim to the town upon the faith of the assertion of brasidas and meanwhile offering to submit the question to arbitration
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.122.5,arbitration however was what the athenians did not choose to risk being determined to send troops at once to the place and furious at the idea of even the islanders now daring to revolt in a vain reliance upon the power of the lacedaemonians by land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.122.6,besides the facts of the revolt were rather as the athenians contended the scionaeans having revolted two days after the convention cleon accordingly succeeded in carrying a decree to reduce and put to death the scionaeans and the athenians employed the leisure which they now enjoyed in preparing for the expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.123.1,meanwhile mende revolted a town in pallene and a colony of the eretrians and was received without scruple by brasidas in spite of its having evidently come over during the armistice on account of certain infringements of the truce alleged by him against the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.123.2,this audacity of mende was partly caused by seeing brasidas forward in the matter and by the conclusions drawn from his refusal to betray scione and besides the conspirators in mende were few and as i have already intimated had carried on their practices too long not to fear detection for themselves and not to wish to force the inclination of the multitude
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.123.3,this news made the athenians more furious than ever and they at once prepared against both towns
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.123.4,brasidas expecting their arrival conveyed away to olynthus in chalcidice the women and children of the scionaeans and mendaeans and sent over to them five hundred peloponnesian heavy infantry and three hundred chalcidian targeteers all under the command of polydamidas leaving these two towns to prepare together against the speedy arrival of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.124.1,brasidas and perdiccas started on a second joint expedition into lyncus against arrhabaeus the latter with the forces of his macedonian subjects and a corps of heavy infantry composed of hellenes domiciled in the country the former with the peloponnesians whom he still had with him and the chalcidians acanthians and the rest in such force as they were able in all there were about three thousand hellenic heavy infantry accompanied by all the macedonian cavalry with the chalcidians near one thousand strong besides an immense crowd of barbarians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.124.2,on entering the country of arrhabaeus they found the lyncestians encamped awaiting them and themselves took up a position opposite
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.124.3,the infantry on either side were upon a hill with a plain between them into which the horse of both armies first galloped down and engaged a cavalry action after this the lyncestian heavy infantry advanced from their hill to join their cavalry and offered battle upon which brasidas and perdiccas also came down to meet them and engaged and routed them with heavy loss the survivors taking refuge upon the heights and there remaining inactive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.124.4,the victors now set up a trophy and waited two or three days for the illyrian mercenaries who were to join perdiccas perdiccas then wished to go on and attack the villages of arrhabaeus and to sit still no longer but brasidas afraid that the athenians might sail up during his absence and of something happening to mende and seeing besides that the illyrians did not appear far from seconding this wish was anxious to return
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.125.1,while they were thus disputing the news arrived that the illyrians had actually betrayed perdiccas and had joined arrhabaeus and the fear inspired by their warlike character made both parties now think it best to retreat however owing to the dispute nothing had been settled as to when they should start and night coming on the macedonians and the barbarian crowd took fright in a moment in one of those mysterious panics to which great armies are liable and persuaded that an army many times more numerous than that which had really arrived was advancing and all but upon them suddenly broke and fled in the direction of home and thus compelled perdiccas who at first did not perceive what had occurred to depart without seeing brasidas the two armies being encamped at a considerable distance from each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.125.2,at daybreak brasidas perceiving that the macedonians had gone on and that the illyrians and arrhabaeus were on the point of attacking him formed his heavy infantry into a square with the light troops in the center and himself also prepared to retreat

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.126.1,peloponnesians if i did not suspect you of being dismayed at being left alone to sustain the attack of a numerous and barbarian enemy i should just have said a few words to you as usual without further explanation as it is in the face of the desertion of our friends and the numbers of the enemy i have some advice and information to offer which brief as they must be will i hope suffice for the more important points
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.126.2,the bravery that you habitually display in war does not depend on your having allies at your side in this or that encounter but on your native courage nor have numbers any terrors for citizens of states like yours in which the many do not rule the few but rather the few the many owing their position to nothing else than to superiority in the field
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.126.3,inexperience now makes you afraid of barbarians and yet the trial of strength which you had with the macedonians among them and my own judgment confirmed by what i hear from others should be enough to satisfy you that they will not prove formidable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.126.4,where an enemy seems strong but is really weak a true knowledge of the facts makes his adversary the bolder just as a serious antagonist is encountered most confidently by those who do not know him thus the present enemy might terrify an inexperienced imagination they are formidable in outward bulk their loud yelling is unbearable and the brandishing of their weapons in the air has a threatening appearance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.126.5,but when it comes to real fighting with an opponent who stands his ground they are not what they seemed they have no regular order that they should be ashamed of deserting their positions when hard pressed flight and attack are with them equally honourable and afford no test of courage their independent mode of fighting never leaving any one who wants to run away without a fair excuse for so doing in short they think frightening you at a secure distance a surer game than meeting you hand to hand otherwise they would have done the one and not the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.126.6,you can thus plainly see that the terrors with which they were at first invested are in fact trifling enough though to the eye and ear very prominent stand your ground therefore when they advance and again wait your opportunity to retire in good order and you will reach a place of safety all the sooner and will know for ever afterwards that rabble such as these to those who sustain their first attack do but show off their courage by threats of the terrible things that they are going to do at a distance but with those who give way to them are quick enough to display their heroism in pursuit when they can do so without danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.127.1,with this brief address brasidas began to lead off his army seeing this the barbarians came on with much shouting and hubbub thinking that he was flying and that they would over take him and cut him off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.127.2,but wherever they charged they found the young men ready to dash out against them while brasidas with his picked company sustained their onset thus the peloponnesians withstood the first attack to the surprise of the enemy and afterwards received and repulsed them as fast as they came on retiring as soon as their opponents became quiet the main body of the barbarians ceased therefore to molest the hellenes with brasidas in the open country and leaving behind a certain number to harass their march the rest went on after the flying macedonians slaying those with whom they came up and so arrived in time to occupy the narrow pass between two hills that leads into the country of arrhabaeus they knew that this was the only way by which brasidas could retreat and now proceeded to surround him just as he entered the most impracticable part of the road in order to cut him off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.128.1,brasidas perceiving their intention told his three hundred to run on without order each as quickly as he could to the hill which seemed easiest to take and to try to dislodge the barbarians already there before they should be joined by the main body closing round him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.128.2,these attacked and overpowered the party upon the hill and the main army of the hellenes now advanced with less difficulty towards it the barbarians being terrified at seeing their men on that side driven from the height and no longer following the main body who they considered had gained the frontier and made good their escape
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.128.3,the heights once gained brasidas now proceeded more securely and the same day arrived at arnisa the first town in the dominions of perdiccas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.128.4,the soldiers enraged at the desertion of the macedonians vented their rage on all their yokes of oxen which they found on the road and on any baggage which had tumbled off as might easily happen in the panic of a night retreat by unyoking and cutting down the cattle and taking the baggage for themselves from this moment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.128.5,perdiccas began to regard brasidas as an enemy and to feel against the peloponnesians a hatred which could not be congenial to the adversary of the athenians however he departed from his natural interests and made it his endeavour to come to terms with the latter and to get rid of the former
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.129.1,on his return from macedonia to torone brasidas found the athenians already masters of mende and remained quiet where he was thinking it now out of his power to cross over into pallene and assist the mendaeans but he kept good watch over torone
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.129.2,for about the same time as the campaign in lyncus the athenians sailed upon the expedition which we left them preparing against mende and scione with fifty ships ten of which were chians one thousand athenian heavy infantry and six hundred archers one hundred thracian mercenaries and some targeteers drawn from their allies in the neighbourhood under the command of nicias son of niceratus and nicostratus son of diitrephes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.129.3,weighing from potidaea the fleet came to land opposite the temple of poseidon and proceeded against mende the men of which town reinforced by three hundred scionaeans with their peloponnesians auxiliaries seven hundred heavy infantry in all under polydamidas they found encamped upon a strong hill outside the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.129.4,these nicias with one hundred and twenty lightarmed methonaeans sixty picked men from the athenian heavy infantry and all the archers tried to reach by a path running up the hill but received a wound and found himself unable to force the position while nicostratus with all the rest of the army advancing upon the hill which was naturally difficult by a different approach further off was thrown into utter disorder and the whole athenian army narrowly escaped being defeated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.129.5,for that day as the mendaeans and their allies showed no signs of yielding the athenians retreated and encamped and the mendaeans at nightfall returned into the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.1,the next day the athenians sailed round to the scione side and took the suburb and all day plundered the country without any one coming out against them partly because of intestine disturbances in the town and the following night the three hundred scionaeans returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.2,on the morrow nicias advanced with half the army to the frontier of scione and laid waste the country while nicostratus with the remainder sat down before the town near the upper gate on the road to potidaea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.3,the arms of the mendaeans and of their peloponnesian auxiliaries within the wall happened to be piled in that quarter where polydamidas accordingly began to draw them up for battle encouraging the mendaeans to make a sortie
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.4,at this moment one of the popular party answered him factiously that they would not go out and did not want a war and for thus answering was dragged by the arm and knocked about by polydamidas hereupon the infuriated commons at once seized their arms and rushed at the peloponnesians and at their allies of the opposite faction
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.5,the troops thus assaulted were at once routed partly from the suddenness of the conflict and partly through fear of the gates being opened to the athenians with whom they imagined that the attack had been concerted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.6,as many as were not killed on the spot took refuge in the citadel which they had held from the first and the whole athenian army nicias having by this time returned and being close to the city now burst into mende which had opened its gates without any convention and sacked it just as if they had taken it by storm the generals even finding some difficulty in restraining them from also massacring the inhabitants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.130.7,after this the athenians told the mendaeans that they might retain their civil rights and themselves judge the supposed authors of the revolt and cut off the party in the citadel by a wall built down to the sea on either side appointing troops to maintain the blockade having thus secured mende they proceeded against scione
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.131.1,the scionaeans and peloponnesians marched out against them occupying a strong hill in front of the town which had to be captured by the enemy before they could invest the place
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.131.2,the athenians stormed the hill defeated and dislodged its occupants and having encamped and set up a trophy prepared for the work of circumvallation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.131.3,not long after they had begun their operations the auxiliaries besieged in the citadel of mende forced the guard by the sea side and arrived by night at scione into which most of them succeeded in entering passing through the besieging army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.132.1,while the investment of scione was in progress perdiccas sent a herald to the athenian generals and made peace with the athenians through spite against brasidas for the retreat from lyncus from which moment indeed he had begun to negotiate
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.132.2,the lacedaemonian ischagoras was just then upon the point of starting with an army overland to join brasidas and perdiccas being now required by nicias to give some proof of the sincerity of his reconciliation to the athenians and being himself no longer disposed to let the peloponnesians into his country put in motion his friends in thessaly with whose chief men he always took care to have relations and go effectually stopped the army and its preparation that they did not even try the thessalians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.132.3,ischagoras himself however with araeinias and aristeus succeeded in reaching brasidas they had been commissioned by the lacedaemonians to inspect the state of affairs and brought out from sparta in violation of all precedent some of their young men to put in command of the towns to guard against their being entrusted to the persons upon the spot brasidas accordingly placed clearidas son of cleonymus in amphipolis and pasitelidas son of hegesander in torone
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.133.1,the same summer the thebans dismantled the wall of the thespians on the charge of atticism having always wished to do so and now finding it an easy matter as the flower of the thespian youth had perished in the battle with the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.133.2,the same summer also the temple of hera at argos was burnt down through chrysis the priestess placing a lighted torch near the garlands and then falling asleep so that they all caught fire and were in a blaze before she observed it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.133.3,chrysis that very night fled to phlius for fear of the argives who agreeably to the law in such a case appointed another priestess named phaeinis chrysis at the time of her flight had been priestess for eight years of the present war and half the ninth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.133.4,at the close of the summer the investment of scione was completed and the athenians leaving a detachment to maintain the blockade returned with the rest of their army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.134.1,during the winter following the athenians and lacedaemonians were kept quiet by the armistice but the mantineans and tegeans and their respective allies fought a battle at laodicium in the oresthid the victory remained doubtful as each side routed one of the wings opposed to them and both set up trophies and sent spoils to delphi
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.134.2,after heavy loss on both sides the battle was undecided and night interrupted the action yet the tegeans passed the night on the field and set up a trophy at once while the mantineans with drew to bucolion and set up theirs afterwards
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.135.1,at the close of the same winter in fact almost in spring brasidas made an attempt upon potidaea he arrived by night and succeeded in planting a ladder against the wall without being discovered the ladder being planted just in the interval between the passing round of the bell and the return of the man who brought it back upon the garrison however taking the alarm immediately afterwards before his men came up he quickly led off his troops without waiting until it was day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:4.135.2,so ended the winter and the ninth year of this war of which thucydides is the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.1.1,the next summer the truce for a year ended after lasting until the pythian games during the armistice the athenians expelled the delians from delos concluding that they must have been polluted by some old offense at the time of their consecration and that this had been the omission in the previous purification of the island which as i have related had been thought to have been duly accomplished by the removal of the graves of the dead the delians had atramyttium in asia given them by pharnaces and settled there as they removed from delos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.2.1,meanwhile cleon prevailed on the athenians to let him set sail at the expiration of the armistice for the towns in the direction of thrace with twelve hundred heavy infantry and three hundred horse from athens a larger force of the allies and thirty ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.2.2,first touching at the still besieged scione and taking some heavy infantry from the army there he next sailed into cophosa harbor in the territory of torone which is not far from the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.2.3,from thence having learnt from deserters that brasidas was not in torone and that its garrison was not strong enough to give him battle he advanced with his army against the town sending ten ships to sail round into the harbor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.2.4,he first came to the fortification lately thrown up in front of the town by brasidas in order to take in the suburb to do which he had pulled down part of the original wall and made it all one city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.3.1,to this point pasitelidas the lacedaemonian commander with such garrison as there was in the place hurried to repel the athenian assault but finding himself hard pressed and seeing the ships that had been sent round sailing into the harbor pasitelidas began to be afraid that they might get up to the city before its defenders were there and the fortification being also carried he might be taken prisoner and so abandoned the outwork and ran into the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.3.2,but the athenians from the ships had already taken torone and their land forces following at his heels burst in with him with a rush over the part of the old wall that had been pulled down killing some of the peloponnesians and toronaeans in the melee and making prisoners of the rest and pasitelidas their commander amongst them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.3.3,brasidas meanwhile had advanced to relieve torone and had only about four miles more to go when he heard of its fall on the road and turned back again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.3.4,cleon and the athenians set up two trophies one by the harbor the other by the fortification and making slaves of the wives and children of the toronaeans sent the men with the peloponnesians and any chalcidians that were there to the number of seven hundred to athens whence however they all came home afterwards the peloponnesians on the conclusion of peace and the rest by being exchanged against other prisoners with the olynthians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.3.5,about the same time panactum a fortress on the athenian border was taken by treachery by the boeotians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.3.6,meanwhile cleon after placing a garrison in torone weighed anchor and sailed round athos on his way to amphipolis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.4.1,about the same time phaeax son of erasistratus set sail with two colleagues as ambassador from athens to italy and sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.4.2,the leontines upon the departure of the athenians from sicily after the pacification had placed a number of new citizens upon the roll and the commons had a design for redividing the land but the upper classes aware of their intention called in the syracusans and expelled the commons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.4.3,these last were scattered in various directions but the upper classes came to an agreement with the syracusans abandoned and laid waste their city and went and lived at syracuse where they were made citizens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.4.4,afterwards some of them were dissatisfied and leaving syracuse occupied phocaeae a quarter of the town of leontini and bricinniae a strong place in the leontine country and being there joined by most of the exiled commons carried on war from the fortifications
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.4.5,the athenians hearing this sent phaeax to see if they could not by some means so convince their allies there and the rest of the sicilians of the ambitious designs of syracuse as to induce them to form a general coalition against her and thus save the commons of leontini
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.4.6,arrived in sicily phaeax succeeded at camarina and agrigentum but meeting with a repulse at gela did not go on to the rest as he saw that he should not succeed with them but returned through the country of the sicels to catana and after visiting bricinniae as he passed and encouraging its inhabitants sailed back to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.5.1,during his voyage along the coast to and from sicily he treated with some cities in italy on the subject of friendship with athens and also fell in with some locrian settlers exiled from messina who had been sent thither when the locrians were called in by one of the factions that divided messina after the pacification of sicily and messina came for a time into the hands of the locrians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.5.2,these being met by phaeax on their return home received no injury at his hands as the locrians had agreed with him for a treaty with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.5.3,they were the only people of the allies who when the reconciliation between the sicilians took place had not made peace with her nor indeed would they have done so now if they had not been pressed by a war with the hipponians and medmaeans who lived on their border and were colonists of theirs phaeax meanwhile proceeded on his voyage and at length arrived at athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.6.1,cleon whom we left on his voyage from torone to amphipolis made eion his base and after an unsuccessful assault upon the andrian colony of stagirus took galepsus a colony of thasos by storm
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.6.2,he now sent envoys to perdiccas to command his attendance with an army as provided by the alliance and others to thrace to polles king of the odomantians who was to bring as many thracian mercenaries as possible and himself remained inactive in eion awaiting their arrival
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.6.3,informed of this brasidas on his part took up a position of observation upon cerdylium a place situated in the argilian country on high ground across the river not far from amphipolis and commanding a view on all sides and thus made it impossible for cleon s army to move without his seeing it for he fully expected that cleon despising the scanty numbers of his opponent would march against amphipolis with the force that he had got with him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.6.4,at the same time brasidas made his preparations calling to his standard fifteen hundred thracian mercenaries and all the edonians horse and targeteers he also had a thousand myrcinian and chalcidian targeteers besides those in amphipolis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.6.5,and a force of heavy infantry numbering altogether about two thousand and three hundred hellenic horse fifteen hundred of these he had with him upon cerdylium the rest were stationed with clearidas in amphipolis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.7.1,after remaining quiet for some time cleon was at length obliged to do as brasidas expected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.7.2,his soldiers tired of their inactivity began also seriously to reflect on the weakness and incompetence of their commander and the skill and valor that would be opposed to him and on their own original unwillingness to accompany him these murmurs coming to the ears of cleon he resolved not to disgust the army by keeping it in the same place and broke up his camp and advanced
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.7.3,the temper of the general was what it had been at pylos his success on that occasion having given him confidence in his capacity he never dreamed of any one coming out to fight him but said that he was rather going up to view the place and if he waited for his reinforcements it was not in order to make victory secure in case he should be compelled to engage but to be enabled to surround and storm the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.7.4,he accordingly came and posted his army upon a strong hill in front of amphipolis and proceeded to examine the lake formed by the strymon and how the town lay on the side of thrace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.7.5,he thought to retire at pleasure without fighting as there was no one to be seen upon the wall or coming out of the gates all of which were shut indeed it seemed a mistake not to have brought down engines with him he could then have taken the town there being no one to defend it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.8.1,as soon as brasidas saw the athenians in motion he descended himself from cerdylium and entered amphipolis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.8.2,he did not venture to go out in regular order against the athenians he mistrusted his strength and thought it inadequate to the attempt not in numbers these were not so unequal but in quality the flower of the athenian army being in the field with the best of the lemnians and imbrians he therefore prepared to assail them by stratagem
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.8.3,by showing the enemy the number of his troops and the shifts which he had been put to to arm them he thought that he should have less chance of beating him than by not letting him have a sight of them and thus learn how good a right he had to despise them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.8.4,he accordingly picked out a hundred and fifty heavy infantry and putting the rest under clearidas determined to attack suddenly before the athenians retired thinking that he should not have again such a chance of catching them alone if their reinforcements were once allowed to come up and so calling all his soldiers together in order to encourage them and explain his intention spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.1,peloponnesians the character of the country from which we have come one which has always owed its freedom to valor and the fact that you are dorians and the enemy you are about to fight ionians whom you are accustomed to beat are things that do not need further comment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.2,but the plan of attack that i propose to pursue this it is as well to explain in order that the fact of our adventuring with a part instead of with the whole of our forces may not damp your courage by the apparent disadvantage at which it places you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.3,i imagine it is the poor opinion that he has of us and the fact that he has no idea of any one coming out to engage him that has made the enemy march up to the place and carelessly look about him as he is doing without noticing us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.4,but the most successful soldier will always be the man who most happily detects a blunder like this and who carefully consulting his own means makes his attack not so much by open and regular approaches as by seizing the opportunity of the moment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.5,and these stratagems which do the greatest service to our friends by most completely deceiving our enemies have the most brilliant name in war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.6,therefore while their careless confidence continues and they are still thinking as in my judgment they are now doing more of retreat than of maintaining their position while their spirit is slack and not highstrung with expectation i with the men under my command will if possible take them by surprise and fall with a run upon their center
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.7,and do you clearidas afterwards when you see me already upon them and as is likely dealing terror among them take with you the amphipolitans and the rest of the allies and suddenly open the gates and dash at them and hasten to engage as quickly as you can
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.8,that is our best chance of establishing a panic among them as a fresh assailant has always more terrors for an enemy than the one he is immediately engaged with
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.9,show yourself a brave man as a spartan should and do you allies follow him like men and remember that zeal honor and obedience mark the good soldier and that this day will make you either free men and allies of lacedaemon or slaves of athens even if you escape without personal loss of liberty or life your bondage will be on harsher terms than before and you will also hinder the liberation of the rest of the hellenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.9.10,no cowardice then on your part seeing the greatness of the issues at stake and i will show that what i preach to others i can practise myself
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.1,after this brief speech brasidas himself prepared for the sally and placed the rest with clearidas at the thracian gates to support him as had been agreed

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.3,upon hearing this he went up to look and having done so being unwilling to venture upon the decisive step of a battle before his reinforcements came up and fancying that he would have time to retire bid the retreat be sounded and sent orders to the men to effect it by moving on the left wing in the direction of eion which was indeed the only way practicable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.4,this however not being quick enough for him he joined the retreat in person and made the right wing wheel round thus turning its unarmed side to the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.5,it was then that brasidas seeing the athenian force in motion and his opportunity come said to the men with him and the rest those fellows will never stand before us one can see that by the way their spears and heads are going troops which do as they do seldom stand a charge quick some one and open the gates i spoke of and let us be out and at them with no fears for the result
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.6,accordingly issuing out by the palisade gate and by the first in the long wall then existing he ran at the top of his speed along the straight road where the trophy now stands as you go by the steepest part of the hill and fell upon and routed the center of the athenians panicstricken by their own disorder and astounded at his audacity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.7,at the same moment clearidas in execution of his orders issued out from the thracian gates to support him and also attacked the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.8,the result was that the athenians suddenly and unexpectedly attacked on both sides fell into confusion and their left towards eion which had already got on some distance at once broke and fled just as it was in full retreat and brasidas was passing on to attack the right he received a wound but his fall was not perceived by the athenians as he was taken up by those near him and carried off the field
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.9,the athenian right made a better stand and though cleon who from the first had no thought of fighting at once fled and was overtaken and slain by a myrcinian targeteer his infantry forming in close order upon the hill twice or thrice repulsed the attacks of clearidas and did not finally give way until they were surrounded and routed by the missiles of the myrcinian and chalcidian horse and the targeteers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.10,thus the athenian army was all now in flight and such as escaped being killed in the battle by the chalcidian horse and the targeteers dispersed among the hills and with difficulty made their way to eion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.11,the men who had taken up and rescued brasidas brought him into the town with the breath still in him he lived to hear of the victory of his troops and not long after expired
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.10.12,the rest of the army returning with clearidas from the pursuit stripped the dead and set up a trophy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.11.1,after this all the allies attended in arms and buried brasidas at the public expense in the city in front of what is now the marketplace and the amphipolitans having enclosed his tomb ever afterwards sacrifice to him as a hero and have given to him the honor of games and annual offerings they constituted him the founder of their colony and pulled down the hagnonic erections and obliterated everything that could be interpreted as a memorial of his having founded the place for they considered that brasidas had been their preserver and courting as they did the alliance of lacedaemon for fear of athens in their present hostile relations with the latter they could no longer with the same advantage or satisfaction pay hagnon his honors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.11.2,they also gave the athenians back their dead about six hundred of the latter had fallen and only seven of the enemy owing to there having been no regular engagement but the affair of accident and panic that i have described
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.11.3,after taking up their dead the athenians sailed off home while clearidas and his troops remained to arrange matters at amphipolis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.12.1,about the same time three lacedaemonians ramphias autocharidas and epicydidas led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy infantry to the towns in the direction of thrace and arriving at heraclea in trachis reformed matters there as seemed good to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.12.2,while they delayed there this battle took place and so the summer ended
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.13.1,with the beginning of the winter following ramphias and his companions penetrated as far as pierium in thessaly but as the thessalians opposed their further advance and brasidas whom they came to reinforce was dead they turned back home thinking that the moment had gone by the athenians being defeated and gone and themselves not equal to the execution of brasidas designs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.13.2,the main cause however of their return was because they knew that when they set out lacedaemonian opinion was really in favour of peace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.14.1,indeed it so happened that directly after the battle of amphipolis and the retreat of ramphias from thessaly both sides ceased to prosecute the war and turned their attention to peace athens had suffered severely at delium and again shortly afterwards at amphipolis and had no longer that confidence in her strength which had made her before refuse to treat in the belief of ultimate victory which her success at the moment had inspired
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.14.2,besides she was afraid of her allies being tempted by her reverses to rebel more generally and repented having let go the splendid opportunity for peace which the affair of pylos had offered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.14.3,lacedaemon on the other hand found the event of the war falsify her notion that a few years would suffice for the overthrow of the power of the athenians by the devastation of their land she had suffered on the island a disaster hitherto unknown at sparta she saw her country plundered from pylos and cythera the helots were deserting and she was in constant apprehension that those who remained in peloponnese would rely upon those outside and take advantage of the situation to renew their old attempts at revolution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.14.4,besides this as chance would have it her thirty years truce with the argives was upon the point of expiring and they refused to renew it unless cynuria were restored to them so that it seemed impossible to fight argos and athens at once she also suspected some of the cities in peloponnese of intending to go over to the enemy as was indeed the case
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.15.1,these considerations made both sides disposed for an accommodation the lacedaemonians being probably the most eager as they ardently desired to recover the men taken upon the island the spartans among whom belonged to the first families and were accordingly related to the governing body in lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.15.2,negotiations had been begun directly after their capture but the athenians in their hour of triumph would not consent to any reasonable terms though after their defeat at delium lacedaemon knowing that they would be now more inclined to listen at once concluded the armistice for a year during which they were to confer together and see if a longer period could not be agreed upon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.16.1,now however after the athenian defeat at amphipolis and the death of cleon and brasidas who had been the two principal opponents of peace on either side the latter from the success and honor which war gave him the former because he thought that if tranquillity were restored his crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less credited the foremost candidates for power in either city pleistoanax son of pausanias king of lacedaemon and nicias son of niceratus the most fortunate general of his time each desired peace more ardently than ever nicias while still happy and honored wished to secure his good fortune to obtain a present release from trouble for himself and his countrymen and hand down to posterity a name as an eversuccessful statesman and thought the way to do this was to keep out of danger and commit himself as little as possible to fortune and that peace alone made this keeping out of danger possible pleistoanax again was assailed by his enemies for his restoration and regularly held up by them to the prejudice of his countrymen upon every reverse that befell them as though his unjust restoration were the cause
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.16.2,the accusation being that he and his brother aristocles had bribed the prophetess of delphi to tell the lacedaemonian deputations which successively arrived at the temple to bring home the seed of the demigod son of zeus from abroad else they would have to plough with a silver share
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.16.3,in this way it was insisted in time he had induced the lacedaemonians in the nineteenth year of his exile to lycaeum whither he had gone when banished on suspicion of having been bribed to retreat from attica and had built half his house within the consecrated precinct of zeus for fear of the lacedaemonians to restore him with the same dances and sacrifices with which they had instituted their kings upon the first settlement of lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.17.1,the smart of this accusation and the reflection that in peace no disaster could occur and that when lacedaemon had recovered her men there would be nothing for his enemies to take hold of whereas while war lasted the highest station must always bear the scandal of everything that went wrong made him ardently desire a settlement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.17.2,accordingly this winter was employed in conferences and as spring rapidly approached the lacedaemonians sent round orders to the cities to prepare for a fortified occupation of attica and held this as a sword over the heads of the athenians to induce them to listen to their overtures and at last after many claims had been urged on either side at the conferences a peace was agreed on upon the following basis each party was to restore its conquests but athens was to keep nisaea her demand for plataea being met by the thebans asserting that they had acquired the place not by force or treachery but by the voluntary adhesion upon agreement of its citizens and the same according to the athenian account being the history of her acquisition of nisaea this arranged the lacedaemonians summoned their allies and all voting for peace except the boeotians corinthians eleans and megarians who did not approve of these proceedings they concluded the treaty and made peace each of the contracting parties swearing to the following articles

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.18.5,the lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back amphipolis to the athenians nevertheless in the case of cities given up by the lacedaemonians to the athenians the inhabitants shall be allowed to go where they please and to take their property with them and the cities shall be independent paying only the tribute of aristides and it shall not be lawful for the athenians or their allies to carry on war against them after the treaty has been concluded so long as the tribute is paid the cities referred to are argilus stagirus acanthus scolus olynthus and spartolus these cities shall be neutral allies neither of the lacedaemonians nor of the athenians but if the cities consent it shall be lawful for the athenians to make them their allies provided always that the cities wish it

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.18.11,if anything be forgotten whatever it be and on whatever point it shall be consistent with their oath for both parties the athenians and lacedaemonians to alter it according to their discretion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.19.1,the treaty begins from the ephoralty of pleistolas in lacedaemon on the th day of the month of artemisium and from the archonship of alcaeus at athens on the th day of the month of elaphebolion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.19.2,those who took the oath and poured the libations for the lacedaemonians were pleistoanax agis pleistolas damagetus chionis metagenes acanthus daithus ischagoras philocharidas zeuxidas antippus tellis alcinadas empedias menas and laphilus for the athenians lampon isthmionicus nicias laches euthydemus procles pythodorus hagnon myrtilus thrasycles theagenes aristocrates iolcius timocrates leon lamachus and demosthenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.20.1,this treaty was made in the spring just at the end of winter directly after the city festival of dionysus just ten years with the difference of a few days from the first invasion of attica and the commencement of this war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.20.2,this must be calculated by the seasons rather than by trusting to the enumeration of the names of the several magistrates or offices of honor that are used to mark past events accuracy is impossible where an even may have occurred in the beginning or middle or at any period in their tenure of office
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.20.3,but by computing by summers and winters the method adopted in this history it will be found that each of these amounting to half a year there were ten summers and as many winters contained in this first war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.21.1,meanwhile the lacedaemonians to whose lot it fell to begin the work of restitution immediately set free all the prisoners of war in their possession and sent ischagoras menas and philocharidas as envoys to the towns in the direction of thrace to order clearidas to hand over amphipolis to the athenians and the rest of their allies each to accept the treaty as it affected them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.21.2,they however did not like its terms and refused to accept it clearidas also willing to oblige the chalcidians would not hand over the town averring his inability to do so against their will
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.21.3,meanwhile he hastened in person to lacedaemon with envoys from the place to defend his disobedience against the possible accusations of ischagoras and his companions and also to see whether it was too late for the agreement to be altered and on finding the lacedaemonians were bound quickly set out back again with instructions from them to hand over the place if possible or at all events to bring out the peloponnesians that were in it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.22.1,the allies happened to be present in person at lacedaemon and those who had not accepted the treaty were now asked by the lacedaemonians to adopt it this however they refused to do for the same reasons as before unless a fairer one than the present were agreed upon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.22.2,and remaining firm in their determination were dismissed by the lacedaemonians who now decided on forming an alliance with the athenians thinking that argos who had refused the application of ampelidas and lichas for a renewal of the treaty would without athens be no longer formidable and that the rest of the peloponnese would be most likely to keep quiet if the coveted alliance of athens were shut against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.22.3,accordingly after conference with the athenian ambassadors an alliance was agreed upon and oaths were exchanged upon the terms following
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.23.1,the lacedaemonians shall be allies of the athenians for fifty years should any enemy invade the territory of lacedaemon and injure the lacedaemonians the athenians shall help them in such way as they most effectively can according to their power but if the invader be gone after plundering the country that city shall be the enemy of lacedaemon and athens and shall be chastised by both and one shall not make peace without the other this to be honestly loyally and without fraud
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.23.2,should any enemy invade the territory of athens and injure the athenians the lacedaemonians shall help them in such way as they most effectively can according to their power but if the invader be gone after plundering the country that city shall be the enemy of lacedaemon and athens and shall be chastised by both and one shall not make peace without the other this to be honestly loyally and without fraud
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.23.3,should the slave population rise the athenians shall help the lacedaemonians with all their might according to their power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.23.4,this treaty shall be sworn to by the same persons on either side that swore to the other it shall be renewed annually by the lacedaemonians going to athens for the dionysia and the athenians to lacedaemon for the hyacinthia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.23.5,and a pillar shall be set up by either party at lacedaemon near the statue of apollo at amyclae and at athens on the acropolis near the statue of athena
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.23.6,should the lacedaemonians and athenians see fit to add to or take away from the alliance in any particular it shall be consistent with their oaths for both parties to do so according to their discretion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.24.1,those who took the oath for the lacedaemonians were pleistoanax agis pleistolas damagetus chionis metagenes acanthus daithus ischagoras philocharidas zeuxidas antippus alcinadas tellis empedias menas and laphilus for the athenians lampon isthmionicus laches nicias euthydemus procles pythodorus hagnon myrtilus thrasycles theagenes aristocrates iolcius timocrates leon lamachus and demosthenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.24.2,this alliance was made not long after the treaty and the athenians gave back the men from the island to the lacedaemonians and the summer of the eleventh year began this completes the history of the first war which occupied the whole of the ten years previously
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.25.1,after the treaty and the alliance between the lacedaemonians and athenians concluded after the ten years war in the ephorate of pleistolas at lacedaemon and the archonship of alcaeus at athens the states which had accepted them were at peace but the corinthians and some of the cities in peloponnese trying to disturb the settlement a fresh agitation was instantly commenced by the allies against lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.25.2,further the lacedaemonians as time went on became suspected by the athenians through their not performing some of the provisions in the treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.25.3,and though for six years and ten months they abstained from invasion of each other s territory yet abroad an unstable armistice did not prevent either party doing the other the most effectual injury until they were finally obliged to break the treaty made after the ten years war and to have recourse to open hostilities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.26.1,the history of this period has been also written by the same thucydides and athenian in the chronological order of events by summers and winters to the time when the lacedaemonians and their allies put an end to the athenian empire and took the long walls and piraeus the war had then lasted for twentyseven years in all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.26.2,only a mistaken judgment can object to including the interval of treaty in the war looked at by the light of facts it cannot it will be found be rationally considered a state of peace where neither party either gave or got back all that they had agreed apart from the violations of it which occurred on both sides in the mantinean and epidaurian wars and other instances and the fact that the allies in the direction of thrace were in as open hostility as ever while the boeotians had only a truce renewed every ten days
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.26.3,so that the first ten years war the treacherous armistice that followed it and the subsequent war will calculating by the seasons be found to make up the number of years which i have mentioned with the difference of a few days and to afford an instance of faith in oracles being for once justified by the event
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.26.4,i certainly all along remember from the beginning to the end of the war its being commonly declared that it would last thrice nine years
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.26.5,i lived through the whole of it being of an age to comprehend events and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact truth about them it was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at amphipolis and being present with both parties and more especially with the peloponnesians by reason of my exile i had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.26.6,i will accordingly now relate the differences that arose after the ten years war the breach of the treaty and the hostilities that followed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.27.1,after the conclusion of the fifty years truce and of the subsequent alliance the embassies from peloponnese which had been summoned for this business returned from lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.27.2,the rest went straight home but the corinthians first turned aside to argos and opened negotiations with some of the men in office there pointing out that lacedaemon could have no good end in view but only the subjugation of peloponnese or she would never have entered into treaty and alliance with the once detested athenians and that the duty of consulting for the safety of peloponnese had now fallen upon argos who should immediately pass a decree inviting any hellenic state that chose such state being independent and accustomed to meet fellowpowers upon the fair and equal ground of law and justice to make a defensive alliance with the argives appointing a few individuals with plenipotentiary powers instead of making the people the medium of negotiation in order that in the case of an applicant being rejected the fact of his overtures might not be made public they said that many would come over from hatred of the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.27.3,after this explanation of their views the corinthians returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.28.1,the persons with whom they had communicated reported the proposal to their government and people and the argives passed the decree and chose twelve men to negotiate an alliance for any hellenic state that wished it except athens and lacedaemon neither of which should be able to join without reference to the argive people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.28.2,argos came in to the plan the more readily because she saw that war with lacedaemon was inevitable the truce being on the point of expiring and also because she hoped to gain the supremacy of peloponnese for at this time lacedaemon had sunk very low in public estimation because of her disasters while the argives were in a most flourishing condition having taken no part in the attic war but having on the contrary profited largely by their neutrality
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.28.3,the argives accordingly prepared to receive into alliance any of the hellenes that desired it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.29.1,the mantineans and their allies were the first to come over through fear of the lacedaemonians having taken advantage of the war against athens to reduce a large part of arcadia into subjection they thought that lacedaemon would not leave them undisturbed in their conquests now that she had leisure to interfere and consequently gladly turned to a powerful city like argos the historical enemy of the lacedaemonians and a sister democracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.29.2,upon the defection of mantinea the rest of peloponnese at once began to agitate the propriety of following her example conceiving that the mantineans would not have changed sides without good reason besides which they were angry with lacedaemon among other reasons for having inserted in the treaty with athens that it should be consistent with their oaths for both parties lacedaemonians and athenians to add to or take away from it according to their discretion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.29.3,it was this clause that was the real origin of the panic in peloponnese by exciting suspicions of a lacedaemonian and athenian combination against their liberties any alteration should properly have been made conditional upon the consent of the whole body of the allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.29.4,with these apprehensions there was a very general desire in each state to place itself in alliance with argos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.30.1,in the meantime the lacedaemonians perceiving the agitation going on in peloponnese and that corinth was the author of it and was herself about to enter into alliance with the argives sent ambassadors thither in the hope of preventing what was in contemplation they accused her of having brought it all about and told her that she could not desert lacedaemon and become the ally of argos without adding violation of her oaths to the crime which she had already committed in not accepting the treaty with athens when it had been expressly agreed that the decision of the majority of the allies should be binding unless the gods or heroes stood in the way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.30.2,corinth in her answer delivered before those of her allies who had like her refused to accept the treaty and whom she had previously invited to attend refrained from openly stating the injuries she complained of such as the nonrecovery of sollium or anactorium from the athenians or any other point in which she thought she had been prejudiced but took shelter under the pretext that she could not give up her thracian allies to whom her separate individual security had been given when they first rebelled with potidaea as well as upon subsequent occasions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.30.3,she denied therefore that she committed any violation of her oaths to the allies in not entering into the treaty with athens having sworn upon the faith of the gods to her thracian friends she could not honestly give them up besides the expression was unless the gods or heroes stand in the way now here as it appeared to her the gods stood in the way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.30.4,this was what she said on the subject of her former oaths as to the argive alliance she would confer with her friends and do whatever was right
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.30.5,the lacedaemonian envoys returning home some argive ambassadors who happened to be in corinth pressed her to conclude the alliance without further delay but were told to attend at the next congress to be held at corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.31.1,immediately afterwards an elean embassy arrived and first making an alliance with corinth went on from thence to argos according to their instructions and became allies of the argives their country being just then at enmity with lacedaemon and lepreum
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.31.2,some time back there had been a war between the lepreans and some of the arcadians and the eleans being called in by the former with the offer of half their lands had put an end to the war and leaving the land in the hands of its leprean occupiers had imposed upon them the tribute of a talent to the olympian zeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.31.3,till the attic war this tribute was paid by the lepreans who then took the war as an excuse for no longer doing so and upon the eleans using force appealed to lacedaemon the case was thus submitted to her arbitrament but the eleans suspecting the fairness of the tribunal renounced the reference and laid waste the leprean territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.31.4,the lacedaemonians nevertheless decided that the lepreans were independent and the eleans aggressors and as the latter did not abide by the arbitration sent a garrison of heavy infantry into lepreum
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.31.5,upon this the eleans holding that lacedaemon had received one of their rebel subjects put forward the convention providing that each confederate should come out of the attic war in possession of what he had when he went into it and considering that justice had not been done them went over to the argives and now made the alliance through their ambassadors who had been instructed for that purpose
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.31.6,immediately after them the corinthians and the thracian chalcidians became allies of argos meanwhile the boeotians and megarians who acted together remained quiet being left to do as they pleased by lacedaemon and thinking that the argive democracy would not suit so well with their aristocratic government as the lacedaemonian constitution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.1,about the same time in this summer athens succeeded in reducing scione put the adult males to death and making slaves of the women and children gave the land for the plataeans to live in she also brought back the delians to delos moved by her misfortunes in the field and by the commands of the god at delphi
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.2,meanwhile the phocians and locrians commenced hostilities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.3,the corinthians and argives being now in alliance went to tegea to bring about its defection from lacedaemon seeing that if so considerable a state could be persuaded to join all peloponnese would be with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.4,but when the tegeans said that they would do nothing against lacedaemon the hitherto zealous corinthians relaxed their activity and began to fear that none of the rest would now come over
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.5,still they went to the boeotians and tried to persuade them to alliance and a common action generally with argos and themselves and also begged them to go with them to athens and obtain for them a ten days truce similar to that made between the athenians and boeotians not long after the fifty years treaty and in the event of the athenians refusing to throw up the armistice and not make any truce in future without corinth these were the requests of the corinthians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.6,the boeotians stopped them on the subject of the argive alliance but went with them to athens where however they failed to obtain the ten days truce the athenian answer being that the corinthians had truce already as being allies of lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.32.7,nevertheless the boeotians did not throw up their ten days truce in spite of the prayers and reproaches of the corinthians for their breach of faith and these last had to content themselves with a de facto armistice with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.33.1,the same summer the lacedaemonians marched into arcadia with their whole levy under pleistoanax son of pausanias king of lacedaemon against the parrhasians who were subjects of mantinea and a faction of whom had invited their aid they also meant to demolish if possible the fort of cypsela which the mantineans had built and garrisoned in the parrhasian territory to annoy the district of sciritis in laconia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.33.2,the lacedaemonians accordingly laid waste the parrhasian country and the mantineans placing their town in the hands of an argive garrison addressed themselves to the defence of their confederacy but being unable to save cypsela or the parrhasian towns went back to mantinea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.33.3,meanwhile the lacedaemonians made the parrhasians independent razed the fortress and returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.34.1,the same summer the soldiers from thrace who had gone out with brasidas came back having been brought from thence after the treaty by clearidas and the lacedaemonians decreed that the helots who had fought with brasidas should be free and allowed to live where they liked and not long afterwards settled them with the neodamodes at lepreum which is situated on the laconian and elean border lacedaemon being at this time at enmity with elis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.34.2,those however of the spartans who had been taken prisoners on the island and had surrendered their arms might it was feared suppose that they were to be subjected to some degradation in consequence of their misfortune and so make some attempt at revolution if left in possession of their franchise these were therefore at once disfranchised although some of them were in office at the time and thus placed under a disability to take office or buy and sell anything after some time however the franchise was restored to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.1,the same summer the dians took thyssus a town on acte by athos in alliance with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.2,during the whole of this summer intercourse between the athenians and peloponnesians continued although each party began to suspect the other directly after the treaty because of the places specified in it not being restored
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.3,lacedaemon to whose lot it had fallen to begin by restoring amphipolis and the other towns had not done so she had equally failed to get the treaty accepted by her thracian allies or by the boeotians or the corinthians although she was continually promising to unite with athens in compelling their compliance if it were longer refused she also kept fixing a time at which those who still refused to come in were to be declared enemies to both parties but took care not to bind herself by any written agreement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.4,meanwhile the athenians seeing none of these professions performed in fact began to suspect the honesty of her intentions and consequently not only refused to comply with her demands for pylos but also repented having given up the prisoners from the island and kept tight hold of the other places until lacedaemon s part of the treaty should be fulfilled
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.5,lacedaemon on the other hand said she had done what she could having given up the athenian prisoners of war in her possession evacuated thrace and performed everything else in her power amphipolis it was out of her ability to restore but she would endeavor to bring the boeotians and corinthians in to the treaty to recover panactum and send home all the athenian prisoners of war in boeotia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.6,meanwhile she required that pylos should be restored or at all events that the messenians and helots should be withdrawn as her troops had been from thrace and the place garrisoned if necessary by the athenians themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.7,after a number of different conferences held during the summer she succeeded in persuading athens to withdraw from pylos the messenians and the rest of the helots and deserters from laconia who were accordingly settled by her at cranii in cephallenia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.35.8,thus during this summer there was peace and intercourse between the two peoples
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.36.1,next winter however the ephors under whom the treaty had been made were no longer in office and some of their successors were directly opposed to it embassies now arrived from the lacedaemonian confederacy and the athenians boeotians and corinthians also presented themselves at lacedaemon and after much discussion and no agreement between them separated for their several homes when cleobulus and xenares the two ephors who were the most anxious to break off the treaty took advantage of this opportunity to communicate privately with the boeotians and corinthians and advising them to act as much as possible together instructed the former first to enter into alliance with argos and then try and bring themselves and the argives into alliance with lacedaemon the boeotians would so be least likely to be compelled to come in to the attic treaty and the lacedaemonians would prefer gaining the friendship and alliance of argos even at the price of the hostility of athens and the rupture of the treaty the boeotians knew that an honorable friendship with agros had been long the desire of lacedaemon for the lacedaemonians believed that this would considerably facilitate the conduct of the war outside peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.36.2,meanwhile they begged the boeotians to place panactum in her hands in order that she might if possible obtain pylos in exchange for it and so be more in a position to resume hostilities with athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.37.1,after receiving these instructions for their governments from xenares and cleobulus and their other friends at lacedaemon the boeotians and corinthians departed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.37.2,on their way home they were joined by two persons high in office at argos who had waited for them on the road and who now sounded them upon the possibility of the boeotians joining the corinthians eleans and mantineans in becoming the allies of argos in the idea that if this could be effected they would be able thus united to make peace or war as they pleased either against lacedaemon or any other power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.37.3,the boeotian envoys were pleased at thus hearing themselves accidentally asked to do what their friends at lacedaemon had told them and the two argives perceiving that their proposal was agreeable departed with a promise to send ambassadors to the boeotians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.37.4,on their arrival the boeotians reported to the boeotarchs what had been said to them at lacedaemon and also by the argives who had met them and the boeotarchs pleased with the idea embraced it with the more eagerness from the lucky coincidence of argos soliciting the very thing wanted by their friends at lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.37.5,shortly afterwards ambassadors appeared from argos with the proposals indicated and the boeotarchs approved of the terms and dismissed the ambassadors with a promise to send envoys to argos to negotiate the alliance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.38.1,in the meantime it was decided by the boeotarchs the corinthians the megarians and the envoys from thrace first to interchange oaths together to give help to each other whenever it was required and not to make war or peace except in common after which the boeotians and megarians who acted together should make the alliance with argos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.38.2,but before the oaths were taken the boeotarchs communicated these proposals to the four councils of the boeotians in whom the supreme power resides and advised them to interchange oaths with all such cities as should be willing to enter into a defensive league with the boeotians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.38.3,but the members of the boeotian councils refused their assent to the proposal being afraid of offending lacedaemon by entering into a league with the deserter corinth the boeotarchs not having acquainted them with what had passed at lacedaemon and with the advice given by cleobulus and xenares and the boeotian partisans there namely that they should become allies of corinth and argos as a preliminary to a junction with lacedaemon fancying that even if they should say nothing about this the councils would not vote against what had been decided and advised by the boeotarchs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.38.4,this difficulty arising the corinthians and the envoys from thrace departed without anything having been concluded and the boeotarchs who had previously intended after carrying this to try and effect the alliance with argos now omitted to bring the argive question before the councils or to send to argos the envoys whom they had promised and a general coldness and delay ensued in the matter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.39.1,in this same winter mecyberna was assaulted and taken by the olynthians having an athenian garrison inside it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.39.2,all this while negotiations had been going on between the athenians and lacedaemonians about the conquests still retained by each and lacedaemon hoping that if athens were to get back panactum from the boeotians she might herself recover pylos now sent an embassy to the boeotians and begged them to place panactum and their athenian prisoners in her hands in order that she might exchange them for pylos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.39.3,this the boeotians refused to do unless lacedaemon made a separate alliance with them as she had done with athens lacedaemon knew that this would be a breach of faith to athens as it had been agreed that neither of them should make peace or war without the other yet wishing to obtain panactum which she hoped to exchange for pylos and the party who pressed for the dissolution of the treaty strongly affecting the boeotian connection she at length concluded the alliance just as winter gave way to spring and panactum was instantly razed and so the eleventh year of the war ended
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.40.1,in the first days of the summer following the argives seeing that the promised ambassadors from boeotia did not arrive and that panactum was being demolished and that a separate alliance had been concluded between the boeotians and lacedaemonians began to be afraid that argos might be left alone and all the confederacy go over to lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.40.2,they fancied that the boeotians had been persuaded by the lacedaemonians to raze panactum and to enter into the treaty with the athenians and that athens was privy to this arrangement and even her alliance therefore no longer open to them a resource which they had always counted upon by reason of the dissensions existing in the event of the noncontinuance of their treaty with lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.40.3,in this strait the argives afraid that as the result of refusing to renew the treaty with lacedaemon and aspiring to the supremacy in peloponnese they would have the lacedaemonians tegeans boeotians and athenians on their hands all at once now hastily sent off eustrophus and aeson who seemed the persons most likely to be acceptable as envoys to lacedaemon with the view of making as good a treaty as they could with the lacedaemonians upon such terms as could be got and being left in peace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.41.1,having reached lacedaemon their ambassadors proceeded to negotiate the terms of the proposed treaty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.41.2,what the argives first demanded was that they might be allowed to refer to the arbitration of some state or private person the question of the cynurian land a piece of frontierterritory about which they have always been disputing and which contains the towns of thyrea and anthene and is occupied by the lacedaemonians the lacedaemonians at first said that they could not allow this point to be discussed but were ready to conclude upon the old terms eventually however the argive ambassadors succeeded in obtaining from them this concession for the present there was to be a truce for fifty years but it should be competent for either party there being neither plague nor war in lacedaemon or argos to give a formal challenge and decide the question of this territory by battle as on a former occasion when both sides claimed the victory pursuit not being allowed beyond the frontier of argos or lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.41.3,the lacedaemonians at first thought this mere folly but at last anxious at any cost to have the friendship of argos they agreed to the terms demanded and reduced them to writing however before any of this should become binding the ambassadors were to return to argos and communicate with their people and in the event of their approval to come at the feast of the hyacinthia and take the oaths the envoys returned accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.42.1,in the meantime while the argives were engaged in these negotiations the lacedaemonian ambassadors andromedes phaedimus and antimenidas who were to receive the prisoners from the boeotians and restore them and panactum to the athenians found that the boeotians had themselves razed panactum upon the plea that oaths had been anciently exchanged between their people and the athenians after a dispute on the subject to the effect that neither should inhabit the place but that they should graze it in common as for the athenian prisoners of war in the hands of the boeotians these were delivered over to andromedes and his colleagues and by them conveyed to athens and given back the envoys at the same time announced the razing of panactum which to them seemed as good as its restitution as it would no longer lodge an enemy of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.42.2,this announcement was received with great indignation by the athenians who thought that the lacedaemonians had played them false both in the matter of the demolition of panactum which ought to have been restored to them standing and in having as they now heard made a separate alliance with the boeotians in spite of their previous promise to join athens in compelling the adhesion of those who refused to accede to the treaty the athenians also considered the other points in which lacedaemon had failed in her compact and thinking that they had been overreached gave an angry answer to the ambassadors and sent them away
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.43.1,the breach between the lacedaemonians and athenians having gone thus far the party at athens also who wished to cancel the treaty immediately put themselves in motion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.43.2,foremost amongst these was alcibiades son of clinias a man yet young in years for any other hellenic city but distinguished by the splendor of his ancestry alcibiades thought the argive alliance really preferable not that personal pique had not also a great deal to do with his opposition he being offended with the lacedaemonians for having negotiated the treaty through nicias and laches and having overlooked him on account of his youth and also for not having shown him the respect due to the ancient connection of his family with them as their proxeni which renounced by his grandfather he had lately himself thought to renew by his attentions to their prisoners taken in the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.43.3,being thus as he thought slighted on all hands he had in the first instance spoken against the treaty saying that the lacedaemonians were not to be trusted but that they only treated in order to be enabled by this means to crush argos and afterwards to attack athens alone and now immediately upon the above breach occurring he sent privately to the argives telling them to come as quickly as possible to athens accompanied by the mantineans and eleans with proposals of alliance as the moment was propitious and he himself would do all he could to help them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.44.1,upon receiving this message and discovering that the athenians far from being privy to the boeotian alliance were involved in a serious quarrel with the lacedaemonians the argives paid no further attention to the embassy which they had just sent to lacedaemon on the subject of the treaty and began to incline rather towards the athenians reflecting that in the event of war they would thus have on their side a city that was not only an ancient ally of argos but a sister democracy and very powerful at sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.44.2,they accordingly at once sent ambassadors to athens to treat for an alliance accompanied by others from elis and mantinea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.44.3,at the same time arrived in haste from lacedaemon an embassy consisting of persons reputed well disposed towards the athenians philocharidas leon and endius for fear that the athenians in their irritation might conclude alliance with the argives and also to ask back pylos in exchange for panactum and in defence of the alliance with the boeotians to plead that it had not been made to hurt the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.45.1,upon the envoys speaking in the senate upon these points and stating that they had come with full powers to settle all others at issue between them alcibiades became afraid that if they were to repeat these statements to the popular assembly they might gain the multitude and the argive alliance might be rejected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.45.2,and accordingly had recourse to the following stratagem he persuaded the lacedaemonians by a solemn assurance that if they would say nothing of their full powers in the assembly he would give back pylos to them himself the present opponent of its restitution engaging to obtain this from the athenians and would settle the other points at issue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.45.3,his plan was to detach them from nicias and to disgrace them before the people as being without sincerity in their intentions or even common consistency in their language and so to get the argives eleans and mantineans taken into alliance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.45.4,this plan proved successful when the envoys appeared before the people and upon the question being put to them did not say as they had said in the senate that they had come with full powers the athenians lost all patience and carried away by alcibiades who thundered more loudly than ever against the lacedaemonians were ready instantly to introduce the argives and their companions and to take them into alliance an earthquake however occurring before anything definite had been done this assembly was adjourned
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.46.1,in the assembly held the next day nicias in spite of the lacedaemonians having been deceived themselves and having allowed him to be deceived also in not admitting that they had come with full powers still maintained that it was best to be friends with the lacedaemonians and letting the argive proposals stand over to send once more to lacedaemon and learn her intentions the adjournment of the war could only increase their own prestige and injure that of their rivals the excellent state of their affairs making it their interest to preserve this prosperity as long as possible while those of lacedaemon were so desperate that the sooner she could try her fortune again the better
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.46.2,he succeeded accordingly in persuading them to send ambassadors himself being among the number to invite the lacedaemonians if they were really sincere to restore panactum intact with amphipolis and to abandon their alliance with the boeotians unless they consented to accede to the treaty agreeably to the stipulation which forbade either party to treat without the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.46.3,the ambassadors were also directed to say that the athenians had they wished to play false might already have made alliance with the argives who were indeed come to athens for that very purpose and went off furnished with instructions as to any other complaints that the athenians had to make
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.46.4,having reached lacedaemon they communicated their instructions and concluded by telling the lacedaemonians that unless they gave up their alliance with the boeotians in the event of their not acceding to the treaty the athenians for their part would ally themselves with the argives and their friends the lacedaemonians however refused to give up the boeotian alliance the party of xenares the ephor and such as shared their view carrying the day upon this point but renewed the oaths at the request of nicias who feared to return without having accomplished anything and to be disgraced as was indeed his fate he being held the author of the treaty with lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.46.5,when he returned and the athenians heard that nothing had been done at lacedaemon they flew into a passion and deciding that faith had not been kept with them took advantage of the presence of the argives and their allies who had been introduced by alcibiades and made a treaty and alliance with them upon the terms following

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.48.2,meanwhile corinth although the ally of the argives did not accede to the new treaty any more than she had done to the alliance defensive and offensive formed before this between the eleans argives and mantineans when she declared herself content with the first alliance which was defensive only and which bound them to help each other but not to join in attacking any
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.48.3,the corinthians thus stood aloof from their allies and again turned their thoughts towards lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.49.1,at the olympic games which were held this summer and in which the arcadian androsthenes was victor the first time in the wrestling and boxing the lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the eleans and thus prevented from sacrificing or contending for having refused to pay the fine specified in the olympic law imposed upon them by the eleans who alleged that they had attacked fort phyrcus and sent heavy infantry of theirs into lepreum during the olympic truce the amount of the fine was two thousand minae two for each heavyarmed soldier as the law prescribes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.49.2,the lacedaemonians sent envoys and pleaded that the imposition was unjust saying that the truce had not yet been proclaimed at lacedaemon when the heavy infantry were sent off
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.49.3,but the eleans affirmed that the armistice with them had already begun they proclaim it first among themselves and that the aggression of the lacedaemonians had taken them by surprise while they were living quietly as in time of peace and not expecting anything
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.49.4,upon this the lacedaemonians submitted that if the eleans really believed that they had committed an aggression it was useless after that to proclaim the truce at lacedaemon but they had proclaimed it notwithstanding as believing nothing of the kind and from that moment the lacedaemonians had made no attack upon their country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.49.5,nevertheless the eleans adhered to what they had said that nothing would persuade them that an aggression had not been committed if however the lacedaemonians would restore lepreum they would give up their own share of the money and pay that of the god for them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.50.1,as this proposal was not accepted the eleans tried a second instead of restoring lepreum if this was objected to the lacedaemonians should ascend the altar of the olympian zeus as they were so anxious to have access to the temple and swear before the hellenes that they would surely pay the fine at a later day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.50.2,this being also refused the lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple the sacrifice and the games and sacrificed at home the lepreans being the only other hellenes who did not attend
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.50.3,still the eleans were afraid of the lacedaemonians sacrificing by force and kept guard with a heavyarmed company of their young men being also joined by a thousand argives the same number of mantineans and by some athenian cavalry who stayed at harpina during the feast
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.50.4,great fears were felt in the assembly of the lacedaemonians coming in arms especially after lichas son of arcesilaus a lacedaemonian had been scourged on the course by the umpires because upon his horses being the winners and the boeotian people being proclaimed the victor on account of his having no right to enter he came forward on the course and crowned the charioteer in order to show that the chariot was his after this incident all were more afraid than ever and firmly looked for a disturbance the lacedaemonians however kept quiet and let the feast pass by as we have seen
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.50.5,after the olympic games the argives and the allies repaired to corinth to invite her to come over to them there they found some lacedaemonian envoys and a long discussion ensued which after all ended in nothing as an earthquake occurred and they dispersed to their different homes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.51.1,summer was now over the winter following a battle took place between the heracleots in trachinia and the aenianians dolopians malians and certain of the thessalians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.51.2,all tribes bordering on and hostile to the town which directly menaced their country accordingly after having opposed and harassed it from its very foundation by every means in their power they now in this battle defeated the heracleots xenares son of cnidis their lacedaemonian commander being among the slain thus the winter ended and the twelfth year of this war ended also
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.52.1,after the battle heraclea was so terribly reduced that in the first days of the summer following the boeotians occupied the place and sent away the lacedaemonian agesippidas for misgovernment fearing that the town might be taken by the athenians while the lacedaemonians were distracted with the affairs of peloponnese the lacedaemonians nevertheless were offended with them for what they had done
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.52.2,the same summer alcibiades son of clinias now one of the generals at athens in concert with the argives and the allies went into peloponnese with a few athenian heavy infantry and archers and some of the allies in those parts whom he took up as he passed and with this army marched here and there through peloponnese and settled various matters connected with the alliance and among other things induced the patrians to carry their walls down to the sea intending himself also to build a fort near the achaean rhium however the corinthians and sicyonians and all others who would have suffered by its being built came up and hindered him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.53.1,the same summer war broke out between the epidaurians and argives the pretext was that the epidaurians did not send an offering for their pastureland to apollo pythaeus as they were bound to do the argives having the chief management of the temple but apart from this pretext alcibiades and the argives were determined if possible to gain possession of epidaurus and thus to insure the neutrality of corinth and give the athenians a shorter passage for their reinforcement from aegina than if they had to sail round scyllaeum the argives accordingly prepared to invade epidaurus by themselves to exact the offering
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.54.1,about the same time the lacedaemonians marched out with all their people to leuctra upon their frontier opposite to mount lycaeum under the command of agis son of archidamus without any one knowing their destination not even the cities that sent the contingents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.54.2,the sacrifices however for crossing the frontier not proving propitious the lacedaemonians returned home themselves and sent word to the allies to be ready to march after the month ensuing which happened to be the month of carneus a holy time for the dorians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.54.3,upon the retreat of the lacedaemonians the argives marched out on the last day but three of the month before carneus and keeping this as the day during the whole time that they were out invaded and plundered epidaurus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.54.4,the epidaurians summoned their allies to their aid some of whom pleaded the month as an excuse others came as far as the frontier of epidaurus and there remained inactive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.55.1,while the argives were in epidaurus embassies from the cities assembled at mantinea upon the invitation of the athenians the conference having begun the corinthian euphamidas said that their actions did not agree with their words while they were sitting deliberating about peace the epidaurians and their allies and the argives were arrayed against each other in arms deputies from each party should first go and separate the armies and then the talk about peace might be resumed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.55.2,in compliance with this suggestion they went and brought back the argives from epidaurus and afterwards reassembled but without succeeding any better in coming to a conclusion and the argives a second time invaded epidaurus and plundered the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.55.3,the lacedaemonians also marched out to caryae but the frontier sacrifices again proving unfavorable they went back again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.55.4,and the argives after ravaging about a third of the epidaurian territory returned home meanwhile a thousand athenian heavy infantry had come to their aid under the command of alcibiades but finding that the lacedaemonian expedition was at an end and that they were no longer wanted went back again so passed the summer
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.56.1,the next winter the lacedaemonians managed to elude the vigilance of the athenians and sent in a garrison of three hundred men to epidaurus under the command of agesippidas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.56.2,upon this the argives went to the athenians and complained of their having allowed an enemy to pass by sea in spite of the clause in the treaty by which the allies were not to allow an enemy to pass through their country unless therefore they now put the messenians and helots in pylos to annoy the lacedaemonians they the argives should consider that faith had not been kept with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.56.3,the athenians were persuaded by alcibiades to inscribe at the bottom of the laconian pillar that the lacedaemonians had not kept their oaths and to convey the helots at cranii to pylos to plunder the country but for the rest they remained quiet as before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.56.4,during this winter hostilities went on between the argives and epidaurians without any pitched battle taking place but only forays and ambuscades in which the losses were small and fell now on one side and now on the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.56.5,at the close of the winter towards the beginning of spring the argives went with scalingladders to epidaurus expecting to find it left unguarded on account of the war and to be able to take it by assault but returned unsuccessful and the winter ended and with it the thirteenth year of the war ended also
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.57.1,in the middle of the next summer the lacedaemonians seeing the epidaurians their allies in distress and the rest of peloponnese either in revolt or disaffected concluded that it was high time for them to interfere if they wished to stop the progress of the evil and accordingly with their full force the helots included took the field against argos under the command of agis son of archidamus king of the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.57.2,the tegeans and the other arcadian allies of lacedaemon joined in the expedition the allies from the rest of peloponnese and from outside mustered at phlius the boeotians with five thousand heavy infantry and as many light troops and five hundred horse and the same number of dismounted troopers the corinthians with two thousand heavy infantry the rest more or less as might happen and the phliasians with all their forces the army being in their country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.58.1,the preparations of the lacedaemonians from the first had been known to the argives who did not however take the field until the enemy was on his road to join the rest at phlius reinforced by the mantineans with their allies and by three thousand elean heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.58.2,they advanced and fell in with the lacedaemonians at methydrium in arcadia each party took up its position upon a hill and the argives prepared to engage the lacedaemonians while they were alone but agis eluded them by breaking up his camp in the night and proceeded to join the rest of the allies at phlius
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.58.3,the argives discovering this at daybreak marched first to argos and then to the nemean road by which they expected the lacedaemonians and their allies would come down
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.58.4,however agis instead of taking this road as they expected gave the lacedaemonians arcadians and epidaurians their orders and went along another difficult road and descended into the plain of argos the corinthians pellenians and phliasians marched by another steep road while the boeotians megarians and sicyonians had instructions to come down by the nemean road where the argives were posted in order that if the enemy advanced into the plain against the troops of agis they might fall upon his rear with their cavalry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.58.5,these dispositions concluded agis invaded the plain and began to ravage saminthus and other places
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.59.1,discovering this the argives came up from nemea day having now dawned on their way they fell in with the troops of the phliasians and corinthians and killed a few of the phliasians and had perhaps a few more of their own men killed by the corinthians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.59.2,meanwhile the boeotians megarians and sicyonians advancing upon nemea according to their instructions found the argives no longer there as they had gone down on seeing their property ravaged and were now forming for battle the lacedaemonians imitating their example
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.59.3,the argives were now completely surrounded from the plain the lacedaemonians and their allies shut them off from their city above them were the corinthians phliasians and pellenians and on the side of nemea the boeotians sicyonians and megarians meanwhile their army was without cavalry the athenians alone among the allies not having yet arrived
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.59.4,now the bulk of the argives and their allies did not see the danger of their position but thought that they could not have a fairer field having intercepted the lacedaemonians in their own country and close to the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.59.5,two men however in the argive army thrasylus one of the five generals and alciphron the lacedaemonian proxenus just as the armies were upon the point of engaging went and held a parley with agis and urged him not to bring on a battle as the argives were ready to refer to fair and equal arbitration whatever complaints the lacedaemonians might have against them and to make a treaty and live in peace in future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.60.1,the argives who made these statements did so upon their own authority not by order of the people and agis on his accepted their proposals and without himself either consulting the majority simply communicated the matter to a single individual one of the high officers accompanying the expedition and granted the argives a truce for four months in which to fulfil their promises after which he immediately led off the army without giving any explanation to any of the other allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.60.2,the lacedaemonians and allies followed their general out of respect for the law but amongst themselves loudly blamed agis for going away from so fair a field the enemy being hemmed in on every side by infantry and cavalry without having done anything worthy of their strength
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.60.3,indeed this was by far the finest hellenic army ever yet brought together and it should have been seen while it was still united at nemea with the lacedaemonians in full force the arcadians boeotians corinthians sicyonians pellenians phliasians and megarians and all these the flower of their respective populations thinking themselves a match not merely for the argive confederacy but for another such added to it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.60.4,the army thus retired blaming agis and returned every man to his home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.60.5,the argives however blamed still more loudly the persons who had concluded the truce without consulting the people themselves thinking that they had let escape with the lacedaemonians an opportunity such as they should never see again as the struggle would have been under the walls of their city and by the side of many and brave allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.60.6,on their return accordingly they began to stone thrasylus in the bed of the charadrus where they try all military causes before entering the city thrasylus fled to the altar and so saved his life his property however they confiscated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.61.1,after this arrived a thousand athenian heavy infantry and three hundred horse under the command of laches and nicostratus whom the argives being nevertheless loth to break the truce with the lacedaemonians begged to depart and refused to bring before the people to whom they had a communication to make until compelled to do so by the entreaties of the mantineans and eleans who were still at argos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.61.2,the athenians by the mouth of alcibiades their ambassador there present told the argives and the allies that they had no right to make a truce at all without the consent of their fellowconfederates and now that the athenians had arrived so opportunely the war ought to be resumed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.61.3,these arguments proving successful with the allies they immediately marched upon orchomenos all except the argives who although they had consented like the rest stayed behind at first but eventually joined the others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.61.4,they now all sat down and besieged orchomenos and made assaults upon it one of their reasons for desiring to gain this place being that hostages from arcadia had been lodged there by the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.61.5,the orchomenians alarmed at the weakness of their wall and the numbers of the enemy and at the risk they ran of perishing before relief arrived capitulated upon condition of joining the league of giving hostages of their own to the mantineans and giving up those lodged with them by the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.62.1,orchomenos thus secured the allies now consulted as to which of the remaining places they should attack next the eleans were urgent for lepreum the mantineans for tegea and the argives and athenians giving their support to the mantineans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.62.2,the eleans went home in a rage at their not having voted for lepreum while the rest of the allies made ready at mantinea for going against tegea which a party inside had arranged to put into their hands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.63.1,meanwhile the lacedaemonians upon their return from argos after concluding the four months truce vehemently blamed agis for not having subdued argos after an opportunity such as they thought they had never had before for it was no easy matter to bring so many and so good allies together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.63.2,but when the news arrived of the capture of orchomenos they became more angry than ever and departing from all precedent in the heat of the moment had almost decided to raze his house and to fine him ten thousand drachmae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.63.3,agis however entreated them to do none of these things promising to atone for his fault by good service in the field failing which they might then do to him whatever they pleased
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.63.4,and they accordingly abstained from razing his house or fining him as they had threatened to do and now made a law hitherto unknown at lacedaemon attaching to him ten spartans as counsellors without whose consent he should have no power to lead an army out of the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.64.1,at this juncture arrived word from their friends in tegea that unless they speedily appeared tegea would go over from them to the argives and their allies if it had not gone over already
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.64.2,upon this news a force marched out from lacedaemon of the spartans and helots and all their people and that instantly and upon a scale never before witnessed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.64.3,advancing to orestheum in maenalia they directed the arcadians in their league to follow close after them to tegea and going on themselves as far as orestheum from thence sent back the sixth part of the spartans consisting of the oldest and youngest men to guard their homes and with the rest of their army arrived at tegea where their arcadian allies soon after joined them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.64.4,meanwhile they sent to corinth to the boeotians the phocians and locrians with orders to come up as quickly as possible to mantinea these had but short notice and it was not easy except all together and after waiting for each other to pass through the enemy s country which lay right across and blocked up the line of communication nevertheless they made what haste they could
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.64.5,meanwhile the lacedaemonians with the arcadian allies that had joined them entered the territory of mantinea and encamping near the temple of heracles began to plunder the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.65.1,here they were seen by the argives and their allies who immediately took up a strong and difficult position and formed in order of battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.65.2,the lacedaemonians at once advanced against them and came on within a stone s throw or javelin s cast when one of the older men seeing the enemy s position to be a strong one hallooed to agis that he was minded to cure one evil with another meaning that he wished to make amends for his retreat which had been so much blamed from argos by his present untimely precipitation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.65.3,meanwhile agis whether in consequence of this halloo or of some sudden new idea of his own quickly led back his army without engaging
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.65.4,and entering the tegean territory began to turn off into that of mantinea the water about which the mantineans and tegeans are always fighting on account of the extensive damage it does to whichever of the two countries if falls into
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.65.5,his object in this was to make the argives and their allies come down from the hill to resist the diversion of the water as they would be sure to do when they knew of it and thus to fight the battle in the plain he accordingly stayed that day where he was engaged in turning off the water the argives and their allies were at first amazed at the sudden retreat of the enemy after advancing so near and did not know what to make of it but when he had gone away and disappeared without their having stirred to pursue him they began anew to find fault with their generals who had not only let the lacedaemonians get off before when they were so happily intercepted before argos but who now again allowed them to run away without any one pursuing them and to escape at their leisure while the argive army was leisurely betrayed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.65.6,the generals halfstunned for the moment afterwards led them down from the hill and went forward and encamped in the plain with the intention of attacking the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.66.1,the next day the argives and their allies formed in the order in which they meant to fight if they chanced to encounter the enemy and the lacedaemonians returning from the water to their old encampment by the temple of heracles suddenly saw their adversaries close in front of them all in complete order and advanced from the hill
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.66.2,a shock like that of the present moment the lacedaemonians do not ever remember to have experienced there was scant time for preparation as they instantly and hastily fell into their ranks agis their king directing everything agreeably to the law
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.66.3,for when a king is in the field all commands proceed from him he gives the word to the polemarchs they to the lochages these to the pentecostyes these again to the enomotarchs and these last to the enomoties
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.66.4,in short all orders required pass in the same way and quickly reach the troops as almost the whole lacedaemonian army save for a small part consists of officers under officers and the care of what is to be done falls upon many
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.67.1,in this battle the left wing was composed of the sciritae who in a lacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone next to these were the soldiers of brasidas from thrace and the neodamodes with them then came the lacedaemonians themselves company after company with the arcadians of heraea at their side after these were the maenalians and on the right wing the tegeans with a few of the lacedaemonians at the extremity their cavalry being posted upon the two wings
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.67.2,such was the lacedaemonian formation that of their opponents was as follows on the right were the mantineans the action taking place in their country next to them the allies from arcadia after whom came the thousand picked men of the argives to whom the state had given a long course of military training at the public expense next to them the rest of the argives and after them their allies the cleonaeans and orneans and lastly the athenians on the extreme left and their own cavalry with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.68.1,such were the order and the forces of the two combatants the lacedaemonian army looked the largest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.68.2,though as to putting down the numbers of either host or of the contingents composing it i could not do so with any accuracy owing to the secrecy of their government the number of the lacedaemonians was not known and men are so apt to brag about the forces of their country that the estimate of their opponents was not trusted the following calculation however makes it possible to estimate the numbers of the lacedaemonians present upon this occasion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.68.3,there were seven companies in the field without counting the sciritae who numbered six hundred men in each company there were four pentecostyes and in the pentecosty four enomoties the first rank of the enomoty was composed of four soldiers as to the depth although they had not been all drawn up alike but as each captain chose they were generally ranged eight deep the first rank along the whole line exclusive of the sciritae consisted of four hundred and fortyeight men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.69.1,the armies being now on the eve of engaging each contingent received some words of encouragement from its own commander the mantineans were reminded that they were going to fight for their country and to avoid returning to the experience of servitude after having tasted that of empire the argives that they would contend for their ancient supremacy to regain their once equal share of peloponnese of which they had been so long deprived and to punish an enemy and a neighbor for a thousand wrongs the athenians of the glory of gaining the honors of the day with so many and brave allies in arms and that a victory over the lacedaemonians in peloponnese would cement and extend their empire and would besides preserve attica from all invasions in future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.69.2,these were the incitements addressed to the argives and their allies the lacedaemonians meanwhile man to man and with their warsongs in the ranks exhorted each brave comrade to remember what he had learnt before well aware that the long training of action was of more saving virtue than any brief verbal exhortation though never so well delivered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.70.1,after this they joined battle the argives and their allies advancing with haste and fury the lacedaemonians slowly and to the music of many fluteplayers a standing institution in their army that has nothing to do with religion but is meant to make them advance evenly stepping in time without breaking their order as large armies are apt to do in the moment of engaging
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.71.1,just before the battle joined king agis resolved upon the following manoeuvre all armies are alike in this on going into action they get forced out rather on their right wing and one and the other overlap with this their adversary s left because fear makes each man do his best to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the right thinking that the closer the shields are locked together the better will he be protected the man primarily responsible for this is the first upon the right wing who is always striving to withdraw from the enemy his unarmed side and the same apprehension makes the rest follow him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.71.2,on the present occasion the mantineans reached with their wing far beyond the sciritae and the lacedaemonians and tegeans still farther beyond the athenians as their army was the largest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.71.3,agis afraid of his left being surrounded and thinking that the mantineans outflanked it too far ordered the sciritae and brasideans to move out from their place in the ranks and make the line even with the mantineans and told the polemarchs hipponoidas and aristocles to fill up the gap thus formed by throwing themselves into it with two companies taken from the right wing thinking that his right would still be strong enough and to spare and that the line fronting the mantineans would gain in solidity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.72.1,however as he gave these orders in the moment of the onset and at short notice it so happened that aristocles and hipponoidas would not move over for which offence they were afterwards banished from sparta as having been guilty of cowardice and the enemy meanwhile closed before the sciritae whom agis on seeing that the two companies did not move over ordered to return to their place had time to fill up the breach in question
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.72.2,now it was however that the lacedaemonians utterly worsted in respect of skill showed themselves as superior in point of courage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.72.3,as soon as they came to close quarters with the enemy the mantinean right broke their sciritae and brasideans and bursting in with their allies and the thousand picked argives into the unclosed breach in their line cut up and surrounded the lacedaemonians and drove them in full rout to the wagons slaying some of the older men on guard there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.72.4,but the lacedaemonians worsted in this part of the field with the rest of their army and especially the center where the three hundred knights as they are called fought round king agis fell on the older men of the argives and the five companies so named and on the cleonaeans the orneans and the athenians next them and instantly routed them the greater number not even waiting to strike a blow but giving way the moment that they came on some even being trodden under foot in their fear of being overtaken by their assailants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.73.1,the army of the argives and their allies having given way in this quarter was now completely cut in two and the lacedaemonian and tegean right simultaneously closing round the athenians with the troops that outflanked them these last found themselves placed between two fires being surrounded on one side and already defeated on the other indeed they would have suffered more severely than any other part of the army but for the services of the cavalry which they had with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.73.2,agis also on perceiving the distress of his left opposed to the mantineans and the thousand argives ordered all the army to advance to the support of the defeated wing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.73.3,and while this took place as the enemy moved past and slanted away from them the athenians escaped at their leisure and with them the beaten argive division meanwhile the mantineans and their allies and the picked body of the argives ceased to press the enemy and seeing their friends defeated and the lacedaemonians in full advance upon them took to flight
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.73.4,many of the mantineans perished but the bulk of the picked body of the argives made good their escape the flight and retreat however were neither hurried nor long the lacedaemonians fighting long and stubbornly until the rout of their enemy but that once effected pursuing for a short time and not far
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.74.1,such was the battle as nearly as possible as i have described it the greatest that had occurred for a very long while among the hellenes and joined by the most considerable states
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.74.2,the lacedaemonians took up a position in front of the enemy s dead and immediately set up a trophy and stripped the slain they took up their own dead and carried them back to tegea where they buried them and restored those of the enemy under truce
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.74.3,the argives orneans and cleonaeans had seven hundred killed the mantineans two hundred and the athenians and aeginetans also two hundred with both their generals on the side of the lacedaemonians the allies did not suffer any loss worth speaking of as to the lacedaemonians themselves it was difficult to learn the truth it is said however that there were slain about three hundred of them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.75.1,while the battle was impending pleistoanax the other king set out with a reinforcement composed of the oldest and youngest men and got as far as tegea where he heard of the victory and went back again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.75.2,the lacedaemonians also sent and turned back the allies from corinth and from beyond the isthmus and returning themselves dismissed their allies and kept the carnean holidays which happened to be at that time
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.75.3,the imputations cast upon them by the hellenes at the time whether of cowardice on account of the disaster in the island or of mismanagement and slowness generally were all wiped out by this single action fortune it was thought might have humbled them but the men themselves were the same as ever
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.75.4,the day before this battle the epidaurians with all their forces invaded the deserted argive territory and cut off many of the guards left there in the absence of the argive army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.75.5,after the battle three thousand elean heavy infantry arriving to aid the mantineans and a reinforcement of one thousand athenians all these allies marched at once against epidaurus while the lacedaemonians were keeping the carnea and dividing the work among them began to build a wall round the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.75.6,the rest left off but the athenians finished at once the part assigned to them round cape heraeum and having all joined in leaving a garrison in the fortification in question they returned to their respective cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.76.1,summer now came to an end in the first days of the next winter when the carnean holidays were over the lacedaemonians took the field and arriving at tegea sent on to argos proposals of accommodation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.76.2,they had before had a party in the town desirous of overthrowing the democracy and after the battle that had been fought these were now far more in a position to persuade the people to listen to terms their plan was first to make a treaty with the lacedaemonians to be followed by an alliance and after this to fall upon the commons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.76.3,lichas son of arcesilaus the argive proxenus accordingly arrived at argos with two proposals from lacedaemon to regulate the conditions of war or peace according as they preferred the one or the other after much discussion alcibiades happening to be in the town the lacedaemonian party who now ventured to act openly persuaded the argives to accept the proposal for an accommodation which ran as follows

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.78.1,the argives began by accepting this proposal and the lacedaemonian army returned home from tegea after this intercourse was renewed between them and not long afterwards the same party contrived that the argives should give up the league with the mantineans eleans and athenians and should make a treaty and alliance with the lacedaemonians which was consequently done upon the terms following

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.80.1,the treaty and above alliance concluded each party at once released everything whether acquired by war or otherwise and thenceforth acting in common voted to receive neither herald nor embassy from the athenians unless they evacuated their forts and withdrew from peloponnese and also to make neither peace nor war with any except jointly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.80.2,zeal was not wanting both parties sent envoys to the thracian places and to perdiccas and persuaded the latter to join their league still he did not at once break off from athens although minded to do so upon seeing the way shown him by argos the original home of his family they also renewed their old oaths with the chalcidians and took new ones
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.80.3,the argives besides sent ambassadors to the athenians bidding them evacuate the fort at epidaurus the athenians seeing their own men outnumbered by the rest of the garrison sent demosthenes to bring them out this general under color of a gymnastic contest which he arranged on his arrival got the rest of the garrison out of the place and shut the gates behind them afterwards the athenians renewed their treaty with the epidaurians and by themselves gave up the fortress
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.81.1,after the defection of argos from the league the mantineans though they held out at first in the end finding themselves powerless without the argives themselves too came to terms with lacedaemon and gave up their sovereignty over the towns
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.81.2,the lacedaemonians and argives each a thousand strong now took the field together and the former first went by themselves to sicyon and made the government there more oligarchical than before and then both uniting put down the democracy at argos and set up an oligarchy favorable to lacedaemon these events occurred at the close of the winter just before spring and the fourteenth year of the war ended
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.82.1,the next summer the people of dium in athos revolted from the athenians to the chalcidians and the lacedaemonians settled affairs in achaea in a way more agreeable to the interests of their country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.82.2,meanwhile the popular party at argos little by little gathered new consistency and courage and waited for the moment of the gymnopaedic festival at lacedaemon and then fell upon the oligarchs after a fight in the city victory declared for the commons who slew some of their opponents and banished others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.82.3,the lacedaemonians for a long while let the messages of their friends at argos remain without effect at last they put off the gymnopaediae and marched to their succor but learning at tegea the defeat of the oligarchs refused to go any further in spite of the entreaties of those who had escaped and returned home and kept the festival
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.82.4,later on envoys arrived with messages from the argives in the town and from the exiles when the allies were also at sparta and after much had been said on both sides the lacedaemonians decided that the party in the town had done wrong and resolved to march against argos but kept delaying and putting off the matter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.82.5,meanwhile the commons at argos in fear of the lacedaemonians began again to court the athenian alliance which they were convinced would be of the greatest service to them and accordingly proceeded to build long walls to the sea in order that in case of a blockade by land with the help of the athenians they might have the advantage of importing what they wanted by sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.82.6,some of the cities in peloponnese were also privy to the building of these walls and the argives with all their people women and slaves not excepted addressed themselves to the work while carpenters and masons came to them from athens summer was now over
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.83.1,the winter following the lacedaemonians hearing of the walls that were building marched against argos with their allies the corinthians excepted being also not without intelligence in the city itself agis son of archidamus their king was in command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.83.2,the intelligence which they counted upon within the town came to nothing they however took and razed the walls which were being built and after capturing the argive town hysiae and killing all the freemen that fell into their hands went back and dispersed every man to his city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.83.3,after this the argives marched into phlius and plundered it for harboring their exiles most of whom had settled there and so returned home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.83.4,the same winter the athenians blockaded macedonia on the score of the league entered into by perdiccas with the argives and lacedaemonians and also of his breach of his engagements on the occasion of the expedition prepared by athens against the chalcidians in the direction of thrace and against amphipolis under the command of nicias son of niceratus which had to be broken up mainly because of his desertion he was therefore proclaimed an enemy and thus the winter ended and the fifteenth year of the war ended with it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.84.1,the next summer alcibiades sailed with twenty ships to argos and seized the suspected persons still left of the lacedaemonian faction to the number of three hundred whom the athenians forthwith lodged in the neighboring islands of their empire the athenians also made an expedition against the isle of melos with thirty ships of their own six chian and two lesbian vessels sixteen hundred heavy infantry three hundred archers and twenty mounted archers from athens and about fifteen hundred heavy infantry from the allies and the islanders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.84.2,the melians are a colony of lacedaemon that would not submit to the athenians like the other islanders and at first remained neutral and took no part in the struggle but afterwards upon the athenians using violence and plundering their territory assumed an attitude of open hostility

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.85.1,since the negotiations are not to go on before the people in order that we may not be able to speak straight on without interruption and deceive the ears of the multitude by seductive arguments which would pass without refutation for we know that this is the meaning of our being brought before the few what if you who sit there were to pursue a method more cautious still make no set speech yourselves but take us up at whatever you do not like and settle that before going any farther and first tell us if this proposition of ours suits you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.86.1,the melian commissioners answered to the fairness of quietly instructing each other as you propose there is nothing to object but your military preparations are too far advanced to agree with what you say as we see you are come to be judges in your own cause and that all we can reasonably expect from this negotiation is war if we prove to have right on our side and refuse to submit and in the contrary case slavery
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.87.1,if you have met to reason about presentiments of the future or for anything else than to consult for the safety of your state upon the facts that you see before you we will give over otherwise we will go on
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.88.1,it is natural and excusable for men in our position to turn more ways than one both in thought and utterance however the question in this conference is as you say the safety of our country and the discussion if you please can proceed in the way which you propose
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.89.1,for ourselves we shall not trouble you with specious pretences either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the mede or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us and make a long speech which would not be believed and in return we hope that you instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the lacedaemonians although their colonists or that you have done us no wrong will aim at what is feasible holding in view the real sentiments of us both since you know as well as we do that right as the world goes is only in question between equals in power while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.90.1,as we think at any rate it is expedient we speak as we are obliged since you enjoin us to let right alone and talk only of interest that you should not destroy what is our common protection the privilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and right and even to profit by arguments not strictly valid if they can be got to pass current and you are as much interested in this as any as your fall would be a signal for the heaviest vengeance and an example for the world to meditate upon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.91.1,the end of our empire if end it should does not frighten us a rival empire like lacedaemon even if lacedaemon was our real antagonist is not so terrible to the vanquished as subjects who by themselves attack and overpower their rulers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.91.2,this however is a risk that we are content to take we will now proceed to show you that we are come here in the interest of our empire and that we shall say what we are now going to say for the preservation of your country as we would fain exercise that empire over you without trouble and see you preserved for the good of us both
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.92.1,and how pray could it turn out as good for us to serve as for you to rule
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.93.1,because you would have the advantage of submitting before suffering the worst and we should gain by not destroying you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.94.1,so that you would not consent to our being neutral friends instead of enemies but allies of neither side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.95.1,no for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your friendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness and your enmity of our power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.96.1,is that your subjects idea of equity to put those who have nothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are most of them your own colonists and some conquered rebels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.97.1,as far as right goes they think one has as much of it as the other and that if any maintain their independence it is because they are strong and that if we do not molest them it is because we are afraid so that besides extending our empire we should gain in security by your subjection the fact that you are islanders and weaker than others rendering it all the more important that you should not succeed in baffling the masters of the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.98.1,but do you consider that there is no security in the policy which we indicate for here again if you debar us from talking about justice and invite us to obey your interest we also must explain ours and try to persuade you if the two happen to coincide how can you avoid making enemies of all existing neutrals who shall look at our case and conclude from it that one day or another you will attack them and what is this but to make greater the enemies that you have already and to force others to become so who would otherwise have never thought of it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.99.1,why the fact is that continentals generally give us but little alarm the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their taking precautions against us it is rather islanders like yourselves outside our empire and subjects smarting under the yoke who would be the most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us into obvious danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.100.1,well then if you risk so much to retain your empire and your subjects to get rid of it it were surely great baseness and cowardice in us who are still free not to try everything that can be tried before submitting to your yoke
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.101.1,not if you are well advised the contest not being an equal one with honor as the prize and shame as the penalty but a question of selfpreservation and of not resisting those who are far stronger than you are
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.102.1,but we know that the fortune of war is sometimes more impartial than the disproportion of numbers might lead one to suppose to submit is to give ourselves over to despair while action still preserves for us a hope that we may stand erect
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.103.1,hope danger s comforter may be indulged in by those who have abundant resources if not without loss at all events without ruin but its nature is to be extravagant and those who go so far as to put their all upon the venture see it in its true colors only when they are ruined but so long as the discovery would enable them to guard against it it is never found wanting

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.104.1,you may be sure that we are as well aware as you of the difficulty of contending against your power and fortune unless the terms be equal but we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good as yours since we are just men fighting against unjust and that what we want in power will be made up by the alliance of the lacedaemonians who are bound if only for very shame to come to the aid of their kindred our confidence therefore after all is not so utterly irrational
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.105.1,when you speak of the favour of the gods we may as fairly hope for that as yourselves neither our pretensions nor our conduct being in any way contrary to what men believe of the gods or practise among themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.105.2,of the gods we believe and of men we know that by a necessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can and it is not as if we were the first to make this law or to act upon it when made we found it existing before us and shall leave it to exist for ever after us all we do is to make use of it knowing that you and everybody else having the same power as we have would do the same as we do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.105.3,thus as far as the gods are concerned we have no fear and no reason to fear that we shall be at a disadvantage but when we come to your notion about the lacedaemonians which leads you to believe that shame will make them help you here we bless your simplicity but do not envy your folly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.105.4,the lacedaemonians when their own interests or their country s laws are in question are the worthiest men alive of their conduct towards others much might be said but no clearer idea of it could be given than by shortly saying that of all the men we know they are most conspicuous in considering what is agreeable honorable and what is expedient just such a way of thinking does not promise much for the safety which you now unreasonably count upon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.106.1,but it is for this very reason that we now trust to their respect for expediency to prevent them from betraying the melians their colonists and thereby losing the confidence of their friends in hellas and helping their enemies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.107.1,then you do not adopt the view that expediency goes with security while justice and honor cannot be followed without danger and danger the lacedaemonians generally court as little as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.108.1,but we believe that they would be more likely to face even danger for our sake and with more confidence than for others as our nearness to peloponnese makes it easier for them to act and our common blood insures our fidelity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.109.1,yes but what an intending ally trusts to is not the goodwill of those who ask his aid but a decided superiority of power for action and the lacedaemonians look to this even more than others at least such is their distrust of their home resources that it is only with numerous allies that they attack a neighbor now is it likely that while we are masters of the sea they will cross over to an island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.110.1,but they would have others to send the cretan sea is a wide one and it is more difficult for those who command it to intercept others than for those who wish to elude them to do so safely
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.110.2,and should the lacedaemonians miscarry in this they would fall upon your land and upon those left of your allies whom brasidas did not reach and instead of places which are not yours you will have to fight for your own country and your own confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.111.1,some diversion of the kind you speak of you may one day experience only to learn as others have done that the athenians never once yet withdrew from a siege for fear of any
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.111.2,but we are struck by the fact that after saying you would consult for the safety of your country in all this discussion you have mentioned nothing which men might trust in and think to be saved by your strongest arguments depend upon hope and the future and your actual resources are too scanty as compared with those arrayed against you for you to come out victorious you will therefore show great blindness of judgment unless after allowing us to retire you can find some counsel more prudent than this
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.111.3,you will surely not be caught by that idea of disgrace which in dangers that are disgraceful and at the same time too plain to be mistaken proves so fatal to mankind since in too many cases the very men that have their eyes perfectly open to what they are rushing into let the thing called disgrace by the mere influence of a seductive name lead them on to a point at which they become so enslaved by the phrase as in fact to fall willfully into hopeless disaster and incur disgrace more disgraceful as the companion of error than when it comes as the result of misfortune
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.111.4,this if you are well advised you will guard against and you will not think it dishonorable to submit to the greatest city in hellas when it makes you the moderate offer of becoming its tributary ally without ceasing to enjoy the country that belongs to you nor when you have the choice given you between war and security will you be so blinded as to choose the worse and it is certain that those who do not yield to their equals who keep terms with their superiors and are moderate towards their inferiors on the whole succeed best
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.111.5,think over the matter therefore after our withdrawal and reflect once and again that it is for your country that you are consulting that you have not more than one and that upon this one deliberation depends its prosperity or ruin
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.112.1,the athenians now withdrew from the conference and the melians left to themselves came to a decision corresponding with what they had maintained in the discussion and answered

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.112.3,meanwhile we invite you to allow us to be friends to you and foes to neither party and to retire from our country after making such a treaty as shall seem fit to us both
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:5.113.1,such was the answer of the melians the athenians now departing from the conference said well you alone as it seems to us judging from these resolutions regard what is future as more certain than what is before your eyes and what is out of sight in your eagerness as already coming to pass and as you have staked most on and trusted most in the lacedaemonians your fortune and your hopes so will you be most completely deceived

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.2.2,the sicanians appear to have been the next settlers although they pretend to have been the first of all and aborigines but the facts show that they were iberians driven by the ligurians from the river sicanus in iberia it was from them that the island before called trinacaria took its name of sicania and to the present day they inhabit the west of sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.2.3,on the fall of ilium some of the trojans escaped from the achaeans came in ships to sicily and settled next to the sicanians under the general name of elymi their towns being called eryx and egesta with them settled some of the phocians carried on their way from troy by a storm first to libya and afterwards from thence to sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.2.4,the sicels crossed over to sicily from their first home italy flying from the opicans as tradition says and as seems not unlikely upon rafts having watched till the wind set down the strait to effect the passage although perhaps they may have sailed over in some other way even at the present day there are still sicels in italy and the country got its name of italy from italus a king of the sicels so called

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.2.6,there were also phoenicians living all round sicily who had occupied promontories upon the sea coasts and the islets adjacent for the purpose of trading with the sicels but when the hellenes began to arrive in considerable numbers by sea the phoenicians abandoned most of their stations and drawing together took up their abode in motye soloeis and panormus near the elymi partly because they confided in their alliance and also because these are the nearest points for the voyage between carthage and sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.3.1,these were the barbarians in sicily settled as i have said of the hellenes the first to arrive were chalcidians from euboea with thucles their founder they founded naxos and built the altar to apollo archegetes which now stands outside the town and upon which the deputies for the games sacrifice before sailing from sicily

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.4.4,near one hundred and eight years after the foundation of gela the geloans founded acragas agrigentum so called from the river of that name and made aristonous and pystilus their founders giving their own institutions to the colony
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.4.5,zancle was originally founded by pirates from cuma the chalcidian town in the country of the opicans afterwards however large numbers came from chalcis and the rest of euboea and helped to people the place the founders being perieres and crataemenes from cuma and chalcis respectively it first had the name of zancle given it by the sicels because the place is shaped like a sickle which the sicels call zanclon but upon the original settlers being afterwards expelled by some samians and other ionians who landed in sicily flying from the medes

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.6.1,such is the list of the peoples hellenic and barbarian inhabiting sicily and such the magnitude of the island which the athenians were now bent upon invading being ambitious in real truth of conquering the whole although they had also the specious design of succouring their kindred and other allies in the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.6.2,but they were especially incited by envoys from egesta who had come to athens and invoked their aid more urgently than ever the egestaeans had gone to war with their neighbours the selinuntines upon questions of marriage and disputed territory and the selinuntines had procured the alliance of the syracusans and pressed egesta hard by land and sea the egestaeans now reminded the athenians of the alliance made in the time of laches during the former leontine war and begged them to send a fleet to their aid and among a number of other considerations urged as a capital argument that if the syracusans were allowed to go unpunished for their depopulation of leontini to ruin the allies still left to athens in sicily and to get the whole power of the island into their hands there would be a danger of their one day coming with a large force as dorians to the aid of their dorian brethren and as colonists to the aid of the peloponnesians who had sent them out and joining these in pulling down the athenian empire the athenians would therefore do well to unite with the allies still left to them and to make a stand against the syracusans especially as they the egestaeans were prepared to furnish money sufficient for the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.6.3,the athenians hearing these arguments constantly repeated in their assemblies by the egestaeans and their supporters voted first to send envoys to egesta to see if there was really the money that they talked of in the treasury and temples and at the same time to ascertain in what posture was the war with the selinuntines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.7.1,the envoys of the athenians were accordingly despatched to sicily the same winter the lacedaemonians and their allies the corinthians expected marched into the argive territory and ravaged a small part of the land and took some yokes of oxen and carried off some corn they also settled the argive exiles at orneae and left them a few soldiers taken from the rest of the army and after making a truce for a certain while according to which neither orneatae nor argives were to injure each other s territory returned home with the army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.7.2,not long afterwards the athenians came with thirty ships and six hundred heavy infantry and the argives joining them with all their forces marched out and besieged the men in orneae for one day but the garrison escaped by night the besiegers having bivouacked some way off the next day the argives discovering it razed orneae to the ground and went back again after which the athenians went home in their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.7.3,meanwhile the athenians took by sea to methone on the macedonian border some cavalry of their own and the macedonian exiles that were at athens and plundered the country of perdiccas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.7.4,upon this the lacedaemonians sent to the thracian chalcidians who had a truce with athens from one ten days to another urging them to join perdiccas in the war which they refused to do and the winter ended and with it ended the sixteenth year of this war of which thucydides is the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.8.1,early in the spring of the following summer the athenian envoys arrived from sicily and the egestaeans with them bringing sixty talents of uncoined silver as a month s pay for sixty ships which they were to ask to have sent them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.8.2,the athenians held an assembly and after hearing from the egestaeans and their own envoys a report as attractive as it was untrue upon the state of affairs generally and in particular as to the money of which it was said there was abundance in the temples and the treasury voted to send sixty ships to sicily under the command of alcibiades son of clinias nicias son of niceratus and lamachus son of xenophanes who were appointed with full powers they were to help the egestaeans against the selinuntines to restore leontini upon gaining any advantage in the war and to order all other matters in sicily as they should deem best for the interests of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.8.3,five days after this a second assembly was held to consider the speediest means of equipping the ships and to vote whatever else might be required by the generals for the expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.8.4,and nicias who had been chosen to the command against his will and who thought that the state was not well advised but upon a slight and specious pretext was aspiring to the conquest of the whole of sicily a great matter to achieve came forward in the hope of diverting the athenians from the enterprise and gave them the following counsel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.9.1,although this assembly was convened to consider the preparations to be made for sailing to sicily i think notwithstanding that we have still this question to examine whether it be better to send out the ships at all and that we ought not to give so little consideration to a matter of such moment or let ourselves be persuaded by foreigners into undertaking a war with which we have nothing to do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.9.2,and yet individually i gain in honour by such a course and fear as little as other men for my person not that i think a man need be any the worse citizen for taking some thought for his person and estate on the contrary such a man would for his own sake desire the prosperity of his country more than others nevertheless as i have never spoken against my convictions to gain honour i shall not begin to do so now but shall say what i think best
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.9.3,against your character any words of mine would be weak enough if i were to advise your keeping what you have got and not risking what is actually yours for advantages which are dubious in themselves and which you may or may not attain i will therefore content myself with showing that your ardour is out of season and your ambition not easy of accomplishment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.10.1,i affirm then that you leave many enemies behind you here to go yonder and bring more back with you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.10.2,you imagine perhaps that the treaty which you have made can be trusted a treaty that will continue to exist nominally as long as you keep quiet for nominal it has become owing to the practices of certain men here and at sparta but which in the event of a serious reverse in any quarter would not delay our enemies a moment in attacking us first because the convention was forced upon them by disaster and was less honourable to them than to us and secondly because in this very convention there are many points that are still disputed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.10.3,again some of the most powerful states have never yet accepted the arrangement at all some of these are at open war with us others as the lacedaemonians do not yet move are restrained by truces renewed every ten days
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.10.4,and it is only too probable that if they found our power divided as we are hurrying to divide it they would attack us vigorously with the siceliots whose alliance they would have in the past valued as they would that of few others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.10.5,a man ought therefore to consider these points and not to think of running risks with a country placed so critically or of grasping at another empire before we have secured the one we have already for in fact the thracian chalcidians have been all these years in revolt from us without being yet subdued and others on the continents yield us but a doubtful obedience meanwhile the egestaeans our allies have been wronged and we run to help them while the rebels who have so long wronged us still wait for punishment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.1,and yet the latter if brought under might be kept under while the sicilians even if conquered are too far off and too numerous to be ruled without difficulty now it is folly to go against men who could not be kept under even if conquered while failure would leave us in a very different position from that which we occupied before the enterprise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.2,the siceliots again to take them as they are at present in the event of a syracusan conquest the favourite bugbear of the egestaeans would to my thinking be even less dangerous to us than before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.3,at present they might possibly come here as separate states for love of lacedaemon in the other case one empire would scarcely attack another for after joining the peloponnesians to overthrow ours they could only expect to see the same hands overthrow their own in the same way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.4,the hellenes in sicily would fear us most if we never went there at all and next to this if after displaying our power we went away again as soon as possible we all know that that which is farthest off and the reputation of which can least be tested is the object of admiration at the least reverse they would at once begin to look down upon us and would join our enemies here against us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.5,you have yourselves experienced this with regard to the lacedaemonians and their allies whom your unexpected success as compared with what you feared at first has made you suddenly despise tempting you further to aspire to the conquest of sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.6,instead however of being puffed up by the misfortunes of your adversaries you ought to think of breaking their spirit before giving yourselves up to confidence and to understand that the one thought awakened in the lacedaemonians by their disgrace is how they may even now if possible overthrow us and repair their dishonour inasmuch as military reputation is their oldest and chiefest study
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.11.7,our struggle therefore if we are wise will not be for the barbarian egestaeans in sicily but how to defend ourselves most effectually against the oligarchical machinations of lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.12.1,we should also remember that we are but now enjoying some respite from a great pestilence and from war to the no small benefit of our estates and persons and that it is right to employ these at home on our own behalf instead of using them on behalf of these exiles whose interest it is to lie as fairly as they can who do nothing but talk themselves and leave the danger to others and who if they succeed will show no proper gratitude and if they fail will drag down their friends with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.12.2,and if there be any man here overjoyed at being chosen to command who urges you to make the expedition merely for ends of his own especially if he be still too young to command who seeks to be admired for his stud of horses but on account of its heavy expenses hopes for some profit from his appointment do not allow such an one to maintain his private splendour at his country s risk but remember that such persons injure the public fortune while they squander their own and that this is a matter of importance and not for a young man to decide or hastily to take in hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.13.1,when i see such persons now sitting here at the side of that same individual and summoned by him alarm seizes me and i in my turn summon any of the older men that may have such a person sitting next him not to let himself be shamed down for fear of being thought a coward if he do not vote for war but remembering how rarely success is got by wishing and how often by forecast to leave to them the mad dream of conquest and as a true lover of his country now threatened by the greatest danger in its history to hold up his hand on the other side to vote that the siceliots be left in the limits now existing between us limits of which no one can complain the ionian sea for the coasting voyage and the sicilian across the open main to enjoy their own possessions and to settle their own quarrels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.13.2,that the egestaeans for their part be told to end by themselves with the selinuntines the war which they began without consulting the athenians and that for the future we do not enter into alliance as we have been used to do with people whom we must help in their need and who can never help us in ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.14.1,and you prytanis if you think it your duty to care for the commonwealth and if you wish to show yourself a good citizen put the question to the vote and take a second time the opinions of the athenians if you are afraid to move the question again consider that a violation of the law cannot carry any prejudice with so many abettors that you will be the physician of your misguided city and that the virtue of men in office is briefly this to do their country as much good as they can or in any case no harm that they can avoid
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.15.1,such were the words of nicias most of the athenians that came forward spoke in favour of the expedition and of not annulling what had been voted although some spoke on the other side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.15.2,by far the warmest advocate of the expedition was however alcibiades son of clinias who wished to thwart nicias both as his political opponent and also because of the attack he had made upon him in his speech and who was besides exceedingly ambitious of a command by which he hoped to reduce sicily and carthage and personally to gain in wealth and reputation by means of his successes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.15.3,for the position he held among the citizens led him to indulge his tastes beyond what his real means would bear both in keeping horses and in the rest of his expenditure and this later on had not a little to do with the ruin of the athenian state
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.15.4,alarmed at the greatness of his license in his own life and habits and of the ambition which he showed in all things soever that he undertook the mass of the people set him down as a pretender to the tyranny and became his enemies and although publicly his conduct of the war was as good as could be desired individually his habits gave offence to every one and caused them to commit affairs to other hands and thus before long to ruin the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.15.5,meanwhile he now came forward and gave the following advice to the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.16.1,athenians i have a better right to command than others i must begin with this as nicias has attacked me and at the same time i believe myself to be worthy of it the things for which i am abused bring fame to my ancestors and to myself and to the country profit besides
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.16.2,the hellenes after expecting to see our city ruined by the war concluded it to be even greater than it really is by reason of the magnificence with which i represented it at the olympic games when i sent into the lists seven chariots a number never before entered by any private person and won the first prize and was second and fourth and took care to have everything else in a style worthy of my victory custom regards such displays as honourable and they cannot be made without leaving behind them an impression of power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.16.3,again any splendour that i may have exhibited at home in providing choruses or otherwise is naturally envied by my fellowcitizens but in the eyes of foreigners has an air of strength as in the other instance and this is no useless folly when a man at his own private cost benefits not himself only but his city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.16.4,nor is it unfair that he who prides himself on his position should refuse to be upon an equality with the rest he who is badly off has his misfortunes all to himself and as we do not see men courted in adversity on the like principle a man ought to accept the insolence of prosperity or else let him first mete out equal measure to all and then demand to have it meted out to him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.16.5,what i know is that persons of this kind and all others that have attained to any distinction although they may be unpopular in their lifetime in their relations with their fellowmen and especially with their equals leave to posterity the desire of claiming connection with them even without any ground and are vaunted by the country to which they belonged not as strangers or illdoers but as fellowcountrymen and heroes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.16.6,such are my aspirations and however i am abused for them in private the question is whether any one manages public affairs better than i do having united the most powerful states of peloponnese without great danger or expense to you i compelled the lacedaemonians to stake their all upon the issue of a single day at mantinea and although victorious in the battle they have never since fully recovered confidence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.1,thus did my youth and socalled monstrous folly find fitting arguments to deal with the power of the peloponnesians and by its ardour win their confidence and prevail and do not be afraid of my youth now but while i am still in its flower and nicias appears fortunate avail yourselves to the utmost of the services of us both
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.2,neither rescind your resolution to sail to sicily on the ground that you would be going to attack a great power the cities in sicily are peopled by motley rabbles and easily change their institutions and adopt new ones in their stead
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.3,and consequently the inhabitants being without any feeling of patriotism are not provided with arms for their persons and have not regularly established themselves on the land every man thinks that either by fair words or by party strife he can obtain something at the public expense and then in the event of a catastrophe settle in some other country and makes his preparations accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.4,from a mob like this you need not look for either unanimity in counsel or concert in action but they will probably one by one come in as they get a fair offer especially if they are torn by civil strife as we are told
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.5,moreover the siceliots have not so many heavy infantry as they boast just as the hellenes generally did not prove so numerous as each state reckoned itself but hellas greatly overestimated their numbers and has hardly had an adequate force of heavy infantry throughout this war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.6,the states in sicily therefore from all that i can hear will be found as i say and i have not pointed out all our advantages for we shall have the help of many barbarians who from their hatred of the syracusans will join us in attacking them nor will the powers at home prove any hindrance if you judge rightly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.7,our fathers with these very adversaries which it is said we shall now leave behind us when we sail and the mede as their enemy as well were able to win the empire depending solely on their superiority at sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.17.8,the peloponnesians had never so little hope against us at present and let them be ever so sanguine although strong enough to invade our country even if we stay at home they can never hurt us with their navy as we leave one of our own behind us that is a match for them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.1,in this state of things what reason can we give to ourselves for holding back or what excuse can we offer to our allies in sicily for not helping them they are our confederates and we are bound to assist them without objecting that they have not assisted us we did not take them into alliance to have them to help us in hellas but that they might so annoy our enemies in sicily as to prevent them from coming over here and attacking us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.2,it is thus that empire has been won both by us and by all others that have held it by a constant readiness to support all whether barbarians or hellenes that invite assistance since if all were to keep quiet or to pick and choose whom they ought to assist we should make but few new conquests and should imperil those we have already won men do not rest content with parrying the attacks of a superior but often strike the first blow to prevent the attack being made
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.3,and we cannot fix the exact point at which our empire shall stop we have reached a position in which we must not be content with retaining but must scheme to extend it for if we cease to rule others we are in danger of being ruled ourselves nor can you look at inaction from the same point of view as others unless you are prepared to change your habits and make them like theirs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.4,be convinced then that we shall augment our power at home by this adventure abroad and let us make the expedition and so humble the pride of the peloponnesians by sailing off to sicily and letting them see how little we care for the peace that we are now enjoying and at the same time we shall either become masters as we very easily may of the whole of hellas through the accession of the sicilian hellenes or in any case ruin the syracusans to the no small advantage of ourselves and our allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.5,the faculty of staying if successful or of returning will be secured to us by our navy as we shall be superior at sea to all the siceliots put together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.6,and do not let the donothing policy which nicias advocates or his setting of the young against the old turn you from your purpose but in the good old fashion by which our fathers old and young together by their united counsels brought our affairs to their present height do you endeavour still to advance them understanding that neither youth nor old age can do anything the one without the other but that levity sobriety and deliberate judgment are strongest when united and that by sinking into inaction the city like everything else will wear itself out and its skill in everything decay while each fresh struggle will give it fresh experience and make it more used to defend itself not in word but in deed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.18.7,in short my conviction is that a city not inactive by nature could not choose a quicker way to ruin itself than by suddenly adopting such a policy and that the safest rule of life is to take one s character and institutions for better and for worse and to live up to them as closely as one can
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.19.1,such were the words of alcibiades after hearing him and the egestaeans and some leontine exiles who came forward reminding them of their oaths and imploring their assistance the athenians became more eager for the expedition than before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.19.2,nicias perceiving that it would be now useless to try to deter them by the old line of argument but thinking that he might perhaps alter their resolution by the extravagance of his estimates came forward a second time and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.20.1,i see athenians that you are thoroughly bent upon the expedition and therefore hope that all will turn out as we wish and proceed to give you my opinion at the present juncture
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.20.2,from all that i hear we are going against cities that are great and not subject to one another or in need of change so as to be glad to pass from enforced servitude to an easier condition or in the least likely to accept our rule in exchange for freedom and to take only the hellenic towns they are very numerous for one island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.20.3,besides naxos and catana which i expect to join us from their connection with leontini there are seven others armed at all points just like our own power particularly selinus and syracuse the chief objects of our expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.20.4,these are full of heavy infantry archers and darters have galleys in abundance and crowds to man them they have also money partly in the hands of private persons partly in the temples at selinus and at syracuse firstfruits from some of the barbarians as well but their chief advantage over us lies in the number of their horses and in the fact that they grow their corn at home instead of importing it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.21.1,against a power of this kind it will not do to have merely a weak naval armament but we shall want also a large land army to sail with us if we are to do anything worthy of our ambition and are not to be shut out from the country by a numerous cavalry especially if the cities should take alarm and combine and we should be left without friends except the egestaeans to furnish us with horse to defend ourselves with
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.21.2,it would be disgraceful to have to retire under compulsion or to send back for reinforcements owing to want of reflection at first we must therefore start from home with a competent force seeing that we are going to sail far from our country and upon an expedition not like any which you may have undertaken in the quality of allies among your subject states here in hellas where any additional supplies needed were easily drawn from the friendly territory but we are cutting ourselves off and going to a land entirely strange from which during four months in winter it is not even easy for a messenger to get to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.22.1,i think therefore that we ought to take great numbers of heavy infantry both from athens and from our allies and not merely from our subjects but also any we may be able to get for love or for money in peloponnese and great numbers also of archers and slingers to make head against the sicilian horse meanwhile we must have an overwhelming superiority at sea to enable us the more easily to carry in what we want and we must take our own corn in merchant vessels that is to say wheat and parched barley and bakers from the mills compelled to serve for pay in the proper proportion in order that in case of our being weatherbound the armament may not want provisions as it is not every city that will be able to entertain numbers like ours we must also provide ourselves with everything else as far as we can so as not to be dependent upon others and above all we must take with us from home as much money as possible as the sums talked of as ready at egesta are readier you may be sure in talk than in any other way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.23.1,indeed even if we leave athens with a force not only equal to that of the enemy except in the number of heavy infantry in the field but even at all points superior to him we shall still find it difficult to conquer sicily or save ourselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.23.2,we must not disguise from ourselves that we go to found a city among strangers and enemies and that he who undertakes such an enterprise should be prepared to become master of the country the first day he lands or failing in this to find everything hostile to him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.23.3,fearing this and knowing that we shall have need of much good counsel and more good fortune a hard matter for mortal men to aspire to i wish as far as may be to make myself independent of fortune before sailing and when i do sail to be as safe as a strong force can make me
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.23.4,this i believe to be surest for the country at large and safest for us who are to go on the expedition if any one thinks differently i resign to him my command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.24.1,with this nicias concluded thinking that he should either disgust the athenians by the magnitude of the undertaking or if obliged to sail on the expedition would thus do so in the safest way possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.24.2,the athenians however far from having their taste for the voyage taken away by the burdensomeness of the preparations became more eager for it than ever and just the contrary took place of what nicias had thought as it was held that he had given good advice and that the expedition would be the safest in the world
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.24.3,all alike fell in love with the enterprise the older men thought that they would either subdue the places against which they were to sail or at all events with so large a force meet with no disaster those in the prime of life felt a longing for foreign sights and spectacles and had no doubt that they should come safe home again while the idea of the common people and the soldiery was to earn wages at the moment and make conquests that would supply a neverending fund of pay for the future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.24.4,with this enthusiasm of the majority the few that liked it not feared to appear unpatriotic by holding up their hands against it and so kept quiet
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.25.1,at last one of the athenians came forward and called upon nicias and told him that he ought not to make excuses or put them off but say at once before them all what forces the athenians should vote him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.25.2,upon this he said not without reluctance that he would advise upon that matter more at leisure with his colleagues as far however as he could see at present they must sail with at least one hundred galleys the athenians providing as many transports as they might determine and sending for others from the allies not less than five thousand heavy infantry in all athenian and allied and if possible more and the rest of the armament in proportion archers from home and from crete and slingers and whatever else might seem desirable being got ready by the generals and taken with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.26.1,upon hearing this the athenians at once voted that the generals should have full powers in the matter of the numbers of the army and of the expedition generally to do as they judged best for the interests of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.26.2,after this the preparations began messages being sent to the allies and the rolls drawn up at home and as the city had just recovered from the plague and the long war and a number of young men had grown up and capital had accumulated by reason of the truce everything was the more easily provided
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.27.1,in the midst of these preparations all the stone hermae in the city of athens that is to say the customary square figures so common in the doorways of private houses and temples had in one night most of them their faces mutilated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.27.2,no one knew who had done it but large public rewards were offered to find the authors and it was further voted that any one who knew of any other act of impiety having been committed should come and give information without fear of consequences whether he were citizen alien or slave
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.27.3,the matter was taken up the more seriously as it was thought to be ominous for the expedition and part of a conspiracy to bring about a revolution and to upset the democracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.28.1,information was given accordingly by some resident aliens and body servants not about the hermae but about some previous mutilations of other images perpetrated by young men in a drunken frolic and of mock celebrations of the mysteries averred to take place in private houses
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.28.2,alcibiades being implicated in this charge it was taken hold of by those who could least endure him because he stood in the way of their obtaining the undisturbed direction of the people and who thought that if he were once removed the first place would be theirs these accordingly magnified the manner and loudly proclaimed that the affair of the mysteries and the mutilation of the hermae were part and parcel of a scheme to overthrow the democracy and that nothing of all this had been done without alcibiades the proofs alleged being the general and undemocratic license of his life and habits
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.29.1,alcibiades repelled on the spot the charges in question and also before going on the expedition the preparations for which were now complete offered to stand his trial that it might be seen whether he was guilty of the acts imputed to him desiring to be punished if found guilty but if acquitted to take the command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.29.2,meanwhile he protested against their receiving slanders against him in his absence and begged them rather to put him to death at once if he were guilty and pointed out the imprudence of sending him out at the head of so large an army with so serious a charge still undecided
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.29.3,but his enemies feared that he would have the army for him if he were tried immediately and that the people might relent in favour of the man whom they already caressed as the cause of the argives and some of the mantineans joining in the expedition and did their utmost to get this proposition rejected putting forward other orators who said that he ought at present to sail and not delay the departure of the army and be tried on his return within a fixed number of days their plan being to have him sent for and brought home for trial upon some graver charge which they would the more easily get up in his absence accordingly it was decreed that he should sail
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.30.1,after this the departure for sicily took place it being now about midsummer most of the allies with the corn transports and the smaller craft and the rest of the expedition had already received orders to muster at corcyra to cross the ionian sea from thence in a body to the iapygian promontory but the athenians themselves and such of their allies as happened to be with them went down to piraeus upon a day appointed at daybreak and began to man the ships for putting out to sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.30.2,with them also went down the whole population one may say of the city both citizens and foreigners the inhabitants of the country each escorting those that belonged to them their friends their relatives or their sons with hope and lamentation upon their way as they thought of the conquests which they hoped to make or of the friends whom they might never see again considering the long voyage which they were going to make from their country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.31.1,indeed at this moment when they were now upon the point of parting from one another the danger came more home to them than when they voted for the expedition although the strength of the armament and the profuse provision which they remarked in every department was a sight that could not but comfort them as for the foreigners and the rest of the crowd they simply went to see a sight worth looking at and passing all belief indeed this armament that first sailed out was by far the most costly and splendid hellenic force that had ever been sent out by a single city up to that time
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.31.2,in mere number of ships and heavy infantry that against epidaurus under pericles and the same when going against potidaea under hagnon was not inferior containing as it did four thousand athenian heavy infantry three hundred horse and one hundred galleys accompanied by fifty lesbian and chian vessels and many allies besides
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.31.3,but these were sent upon a short voyage and with a scanty equipment the present expedition was formed in contemplation of a long term of service by land and sea alike and was furnished with ships and troops so as to be ready for either as required the fleet had been elaborately equipped at great cost to the captains and the state the treasury giving a drachma a day to each seaman and providing empty ships sixty men of war and forty transports and manning these with the best crews obtainable while the captains gave a bounty in addition to the pay from the treasury to the thranitae and crews generally besides spending lavishly upon figureheads and equipments and one and all making the utmost exertions to enable their own ships to excel in beauty and fast sailing meanwhile the land forces had been picked from the best musterrolls and vied with each other in paying great attention to their arms and personal accoutrements
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.31.4,from this resulted not only a rivalry among themselves in their different departments but an idea among the rest of the hellenes that it was more a display of power and resources than an armament against an enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.31.5,for if any one had counted up the public expenditure of the state and the private outlay of individuals that is to say the sums which the state had already spent upon the expedition and was sending out in the hands of the generals and those which individuals had expended upon their personal outfit or as captains of galleys had laid out and were still to lay out upon their vessels and if he had added to this the journey money which each was likely to have provided himself with independently of the pay from the treasury for a voyage of such length and what the soldiers or traders took with them for the purpose of exchange it would have been found that many talents in all were being taken out of the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.31.6,indeed the expedition became not less famous for its wonderful boldness and for the splendour of its appearance than for its overwhelming strength as compared with the peoples against whom it was directed and for the fact that this was the longest passage from home hitherto attempted and the most ambitious in its objects considering the resources of those who undertook it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.32.1,the ships being now manned and everything put on board with which they meant to sail the trumpet commanded silence and the prayers customary before putting out to sea were offered not in each ship by itself but by all together to the voice of a herald and bowls of wine were mixed through all the armament and libations made by the soldiers and their officers in gold and silver goblets
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.32.2,in their prayers joined also the crowds on shore the citizens and all others that wished them well the hymn sung and the libations finished they put out to sea and first sailing out in column then raced each other as far as aegina and so hastened to reach corcyra where the rest of the allied forces were also assembling
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.32.3,meanwhile at syracuse news came in from many quarters of the expedition but for a long while met with no credence whatever indeed an assembly was held in which speeches as will be seen were delivered by different orators believing or contradicting the report of the athenian expedition among whom hermocrates son of hermon came forward being persuaded that he knew the truth of the matter and gave the following counsel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.33.1,although i shall perhaps be no better believed than others have been when i speak upon the reality of the expedition and although i know that those who either make or repeat statements thought not worthy of belief not only gain no converts but are thought fools for their pains i shall certainly not be frightened into holding my tongue when the state is in danger and when i am persuaded that i can speak with more authority on the matter than other persons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.33.2,much as you wonder at it the athenians nevertheless have set out against us with a large force naval and military professedly to help the egestaeans and to restore leontini but really to conquer sicily and above all our city which once gained the rest they think will easily follow

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.33.4,meanwhile those who believe me need not be dismayed at the force or daring of the enemy they will not be able to do us more hurt than we shall do them nor is the greatness of their armament altogether without advantage to us indeed the greater it is the better with regard to the rest of the siceliots whom dismay will make more ready to join us and if we defeat or drive them away disappointed of the objects of their ambition for i do not fear for a moment that they will get what they want it will be a most glorious exploit for us and in my judgment by no means an unlikely one
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.33.5,few indeed have been the large armaments either hellenic or barbarian that have gone far from home and been successful they cannot be more numerous than the people of the country and their neighbours all of whom fear leagues together and if they miscarry for want of supplies in a foreign land to those against whom their plans were laid none the less they leave renown although they may themselves have been the main cause of their own discomfort
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.33.6,thus these very athenians rose by the defeat of the mede in a great measure due to accidental causes from the mere fact that athens had been the object of his attack and this may very well be the case with us also
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.1,let us therefore confidently begin preparations here let us send and confirm some of the sicels and obtain the friendship and alliance of others and despatch envoys to the rest of sicily to show that the danger is common to all and to italy to get them to become our allies or at all events to refuse to receive the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.2,i also think that it would be best to send to carthage as well they are by no means there without apprehension but it is their constant fear that the athenians may one day attack their city and they may perhaps think that they might themselves suffer by letting sicily be sacrificed and be willing to help us secretly if not openly in one way if not in another they are the best able to do so if they will of any of the present day as they possess most gold and silver by which war like everything else flourishes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.3,let us also send to lacedaemon and corinth and ask them to come here and help us as soon as possible and to keep alive the war in hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.4,but the true thing of all others in my opinion to do at the present moment is what you with your constitutional love of quiet will be slow to see and what i must nevertheless mention if we siceliots all together or at least as many as possible besides ourselves would only launch the whole of our actual navy with two months provisions and meet the athenians at tarentum and the iapygian promontory and show them that before fighting for sicily they must first fight for their passage across the ionian sea we should strike dismay into their army and set them on thinking that we have a base for our defensive for tarentum is ready to receive us while they have a wide sea to cross with all their armament which could with difficulty keep its order through so long a voyage and would be easy for us to attack as it came on slowly and in small detachments
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.5,on the other hand if they were to lighten their vessels and draw together their fast sailors and with these attack us we could either fall upon them when they were wearied with rowing or if we did not choose to do so we could retire to tarentum while they having crossed with few provisions just to give battle would be hard put to it in desolate places and would either have to remain and be blockaded or to try to sail along the coast abandoning the rest of their armament and being further discouraged by not knowing for certain whether the cities would receive them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.6,in my opinion this consideration alone would be sufficient to deter them from putting out from corcyra and what with deliberating and reconnoitring our numbers and whereabouts they would let the season go on until winter was upon them or confounded by so unexpected a circumstance would break up the expedition especially as their most experienced general has as i hear taken the command against his will and would grasp at the first excuse offered by any serious demonstration of ours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.7,we should also be reported i am certain as more numerous than we really are and men s minds are affected by what they hear and besides the first to attack or to show that they mean to defend themselves against an attack inspire greater fear because men see that they are ready for the emergency
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.8,this would just be the case with the athenians at present they are now attacking us in the belief that we shall not resist having a right to judge us severely because we did not help the lacedaemonians in crushing them but if they were to see us showing a courage for which they are not prepared they would be more dismayed by the surprise than they could ever be by our actual power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.34.9,i could wish to persuade you to show this courage but if this cannot be at all events lose not a moment in preparing generally for the war and remember all of you that contempt for an assailant is best shown by bravery in action but that for the present the best course is to accept the preparations which fear inspires as giving the surest promise of safety and to act as if the danger was real that the athenians are coming to attack us and are already upon the voyage and all but here this is what i am sure of
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.35.1,thus far spoke hermocrates meanwhile the people of syracuse were at great strife among themselves some contending that the athenians had no idea of coming and that there was no truth in what he said some asking if they did come what harm they could do that would not be repaid them tenfold in return while others made light of the whole affair and turned it into ridicule in short there were few that believed hermocrates and feared for the future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.35.2,meanwhile athenagoras the leader of the people and very powerful at that time with the masses came forward and spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.36.1,for the athenians he who does not wish that they may be as misguided as they are supposed to be and that they may come here to become our subjects is either a coward or a traitor to his country while as for those who carry such tidings and fill you with so much alarm i wonder less at their audacity than at their folly if they flatter themselves that we do not see through them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.36.2,the fact is that they have their private reasons to be afraid and wish to throw the city into consternation to have their own terrors cast into the shade by the public alarm in short this is what these reports are worth they do not arise of themselves but are concocted by men who are always causing agitation here in sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.36.3,however if you are well advised you will not be guided in your calculation of probabilities by what these persons tell you but by what shrewd men and of large experience as i esteem the athenians to be would be likely to do
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.36.4,now it is not likely that they would leave the peloponnesians behind them and before they have well ended the war in hellas wantonly come in quest of a new war quite as arduous in sicily indeed in my judgment they are only too glad that we do not go and attack them being so many and so great cities as we are
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.37.1,however if they should come as is reported i consider sicily better able to go through with the war than peloponnese as being at all points better prepared and our city by itself far more than a match for this pretended army of invasion even were it twice as large again i know that they will not have horses with them or get any here except a few perhaps from the egestaeans or be able to bring a force of heavy infantry equal in number to our own in ships which will already have enough to do to come all this distance however lightly laden not to speak of the transport of the other stores required against a city of this magnitude which will be no slight quantity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.37.2,in fact so strong is my opinion upon the subject that i do not well see how they could avoid annihilation if they brought with them another city as large as syracuse and settled down and carried on war from our frontier much less can they hope to succeed with all sicily hostile to them as all sicily will be and with only a camp pitched from the ships and composed of tents and bare necessaries from which they would not be able to stir far for fear of our cavalry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.38.1,but the athenians see this as i tell you and as i have reason to know are looking after their possessions at home while persons here invent stories that neither are true nor ever will be
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.38.2,nor is this the first time that i see these persons when they cannot resort to deeds trying by such stories and by others even more abominable to frighten your people and get into their hands the government it is what i see always and i cannot help fearing that trying so often they may one day succeed and that we as long as we do not feel the smart may prove too weak for the task of prevention or when the offenders are known of pursuit
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.38.3,the result is that our city is rarely at rest but is subject to constant troubles and to contests as frequent against herself as against the enemy not to speak of occasional tyrannies and infamous cabals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.38.4,however i will try if you will support me to let nothing of this happen in our time by gaining you the many and by chastising the authors of such machinations not merely when they are caught in the act a difficult feat to accomplish but also for what they have the wish though not the power to do as is necessary to punish an enemy not only for what he does but also beforehand for what he intends to do if the first to relax precaution would not be also the first to suffer i shall also reprove watch and on occasion warn the few the most effectual way in my opinion of turning them from their evil courses
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.38.5,and after all as i have often asked what would you have young men would you hold office at once the law forbids it a law enacted rather because you are not competent than to disgrace you when competent meanwhile you would not be on a legal equality with the many but how can it be right that citizens of the same state should be held unworthy of the same privileges
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.39.1,it will be said perhaps that democracy is neither wise nor equitable but that the holders of property are also the best fitted to rule i say on the contrary first that the word demos or people includes the whole state oligarchy only a part next that if the best guardians of property are the rich and the best counsellors the wise none can hear and decide so well as the many and that all these talents severally and collectively have their just place in a democracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.39.2,but an oligarchy gives the many their share of the danger and not content with the largest part takes and keeps the whole of the profit and this is what the powerful and young among you aspire to but in a great city cannot possibly obtain
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.40.1,but even now foolish men most senseless of all the hellenes that i know if you have no sense of the wickedness of your designs or most criminal if you have that sense and still dare to pursue them even now if it is not a case for repentance you may still learn wisdom and thus advance the interest of the country the common interest of us all reflect that in the country s prosperity the men of merit in your ranks will have a share and a larger share than the great mass of your fellowcountrymen but that if you have other designs you run a risk of being deprived of all and desist from reports like these as the people know your object and will not put up with it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.40.2,if the athenians arrive this city will repulse them in a manner worthy of itself we have moreover generals who will see to this matter and if nothing of this be true as i incline to believe the city will not be thrown into a panic by your intelligence or impose upon itself a selfchosen servitude by choosing you for its rulers the city itself will look into the matter and will judge your words as if they were acts and instead of allowing itself to be deprived of its liberty by listening to you will strive to preserve that liberty by taking care to have always at hand the means of making itself respected
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.41.1,such were the words of athenagoras one of the generals now stood up and stopped any other speakers coming forward adding these words of his own with reference to the matter in hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.41.2,it is not well for speakers to utter calumnies against one another or for their hearers to entertain them we ought rather to look to the intelligence that we have received and see how each man by himself and the city as a whole may best prepare to repel the invaders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.41.3,even if there be no need there is no harm in the state being furnished with horses and arms and all other insignia of war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.41.4,and we will undertake to see to and order this and to send round to the cities to reconnoitre and do all else that may appear desirable part of this we have seen to already and whatever we discover shall be laid before you after these words from the general the syracusans departed from the assembly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.42.1,in the meantime the athenians with all their allies had now arrived at corcyra here the generals began by again reviewing the armament and made arrangements as to the order in which they were to anchor and encamp and dividing the whole fleet into three divisions allotted one to each of their number to avoid sailing all together and being thus embarrassed for water harbourage or provisions at the stations which they might touch at and at the same time to be generally better ordered and easier to handle by each squadron having its own commander
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.42.2,next they sent on three ships to italy and sicily to find out which of the cities would receive them with instructions to meet them on the way and let them know before they put in to land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.43.1,after this the athenians weighed from corcyra and proceeded to cross to sicily with an armament now consisting of one hundred and thirtyfour galleys in all besides two rhodian fiftyoars of which one hundred were athenian vessels sixty menofwar and forty troopships and the remainder from chios and the other allies five thousand and one hundred heavy infantry in all that is to say fifteen hundred athenian citizens from the rolls at athens and seven hundred thetes shipped as marines and the rest allied troops some of them athenian subjects and besides these five hundred argives and two hundred and fifty mantineans serving for hire four hundred and eighty archers in all eighty of whom were cretans seven hundred slingers from rhodes one hundred and twenty lightarmed exiles from megara and one horsetransport carrying thirty horses
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.44.1,such was the strength of the first armament that sailed over for the war the supplies for this force were carried by thirty ships of burden laden with corn which conveyed the bakers stonemasons and carpenters and the tools for raising fortifications accompanied by one hundred boats like the former pressed into the service besides many other boats and ships of burden which followed the armament voluntarily for purposes of trade all of which now left corcyra and struck across the ionian sea together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.44.2,the whole force making land at the iapygian promontory and tarentum with more or less good fortune coasted along the shores of italy the cities shutting their markets and gates against them and according them nothing but water and liberty to anchor and tarentum and locri not even that until they arrived at rhegium the extreme point of italy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.44.3,here at length they reunited and not gaining admission within the walls pitched a camp outside the city in the precinct of artemis where a market was also provided for them and drew their ships on shore and kept quiet meanwhile they opened negotiations with the rhegians and called upon them as chalcidians to assist their leontine kinsmen to which the rhegians replied that they would not side with either party but should await the decision of the rest of the italiots and do as they did
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.44.4,upon this the athenians now began to consider what would be the best action to take in the affairs of sicily and meanwhile waited for the ships sent on to come back from egesta in order to know whether there was really there the money mentioned by the messengers at athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.45.1,in the meantime came in from all quarters to the syracusans as well as from their own officers sent to reconnoitre the positive tidings that the fleet was at rhegium upon which they laid aside their incredulity and threw themselves heart and soul into the work of preparation guards or envoys as the case might be were sent round to the sicels garrisons put into the posts of the peripoli in the country horses and arms reviewed in the city to see that nothing was wanting and all other steps taken to prepare for a war which might be upon them at any moment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.46.1,meanwhile the three ships that had been sent on came from egesta to the athenians at rhegium with the news that so far from there being the sums promised all that could be produced was thirty talents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.46.2,the generals were not a little disheartened at being thus disappointed at the outset and by the refusal to join in the expedition of the rhegians the people they had first tried to gain and had had most reason to count upon from their relationship to the leontines and constant friendship for athens if nicias was prepared for the news from egesta his two colleagues were taken completely by surprise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.46.3,the egestaeans had had recourse to the following stratagem when the first envoys from athens came to inspect their resources they took the envoys in question to the temple of aphrodite at eryx and showed them the treasures deposited there bowls wineladles censers and a large number of other pieces of plate which from being in silver gave an impression of wealth quite out of proportion to their really small value they also privately entertained the ships crews and collected all the cups of gold and silver that they could find in egesta itself or could borrow in the neighbouring phoenician and hellenic towns and each brought them to the banquets as their own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.46.4,and as all used pretty nearly the same and everywhere a great quantity of plate was shown the effect was most dazzling upon the athenian sailors and made them talk loudly of the riches they had seen when they got back to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.46.5,the dupes in question who had in their turn persuaded the rest when the news got abroad that there was not the money supposed at egesta were much blamed by the soldiers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.47.1,meanwhile the generals consulted upon what was to be done the opinion of nicias was to sail with all the armament to selinus the main object of the expedition and if the egestaeans could provide money for the whole force to advise accordingly but if they could not to require them to supply provisions for the sixty ships that they had asked for to stay and settle matters between them and the selinuntines either by force or by agreement and then to coast past the other cities and after displaying the power of athens and proving their zeal for their friends and allies to sail home again unless they should have some sudden and unexpected opportunity of serving the leontines or of bringing over some of the other cities and not to endanger the state by wasting its home resources
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.48.1,alcibiades said that a great expedition like the present must not disgrace itself by going away without having done anything heralds must be sent to all the cities except selinus and syracuse and efforts be made to make some of the sicels revolt from the syracusans and to obtain the friendship of others in order to have corn and troops and first of all to gain the messinese who lay right in the passage and entrance to sicily and would afford an excellent harbour and base for the army thus after bringing over the towns and knowing who would be their allies in the war they might at length attack syracuse and selinus unless the latter came to terms with egesta and the former ceased to oppose the restoration of leontini
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.49.1,lamachus on the other hand said that they ought to sail straight to syracuse and fight their battle at once under the walls of the town while the people were still unprepared and the panic at its height
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.49.2,every armament was most terrible at first if it allowed time to run on without showing itself men s courage revived and they saw it appear at last almost with indifference by attacking suddenly while syracuse still trembled at their coming they would have the best chance of gaining a victory for themselves and of striking a complete panic into the enemy by the aspect of their numbers which would never appear so considerable as at present by the anticipation of coming disaster and above all by the immediate danger of the engagement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.49.3,they might also count upon surprising many in the fields outside incredulous of their coming and at the moment that the enemy was carrying in his property the army would not want for booty if it sat down in force before the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.49.4,the rest of the siceliots would thus be immediately less disposed to enter into alliance with the syracusans and would join the athenians without waiting to see which were the strongest they must make megara their naval station as a place to retreat to and a base from which to attack it was an uninhabited place at no great distance from syracuse either by land or by sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.50.1,after speaking to this effect lamachus nevertheless gave his support to the opinion of alcibiades after this alcibiades sailed in his own vessel across to messina with proposals of alliance but met with no success the inhabitants answering that they could not receive him within their walls though they would provide him with a market outside upon this he sailed back to rhegium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.50.2,immediately upon his return the generals manned and victualled sixty ships out of the whole fleet and coasted along to naxos leaving the rest of the armament behind them at rhegium with one of their number
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.50.3,received by the naxians they then coasted on to catana and being refused admittance by the inhabitants there being a syracusan party in the town went on to the river terias
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.50.4,here they bivouacked and the next day sailed in single file to syracuse with all their ships except ten which they sent on in front to sail into the great harbour and see if there was any fleet launched and to proclaim by herald from shipboard that the athenians were come to restore the leontines to their country as being their allies and kinsmen and that such of them therefore as were in syracuse should leave it without fear and join their friends and benefactors the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.50.5,after making this proclamation and reconnoitring the city and the harbours and the features of the country which they would have to make their base of operations in the war they sailed back to catana
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.51.1,an assembly being held here the inhabitants refused to received the armament but invited the generals to come in and say what they desired and while alcibiades was speaking and the citizens were intent on the assembly the soldiers broke down an illwalledup posterngate without being observed and getting inside the town flocked into the marketplace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.51.2,the syracusan party in the town no sooner saw the army inside than they became frightened and withdrew not being at all numerous while the rest voted for an alliance with the athenians and invited them to fetch the rest of their forces from rhegium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.51.3,after this the athenians sailed to rhegium and put off this time with all the armament for catana and fell to work at their camp immediately upon their arrival
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.52.1,meanwhile word was brought them from camarina that if they went there the town would go over to them and also that the syracusans were manning a fleet the athenians accordingly sailed along shore with all their armament first to syracuse where they found no fleet manning and so always along the coast to camarina where they brought to at the beach and sent a herald to the people who however refused to receive them saying that their oaths bound them to receive the athenians only with a single vessel unless they themselves sent for more
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.52.2,disappointed here the athenians now sailed back again and after landing and plundering on syracusan territory and losing some stragglers from their light infantry through the coming up of the syracusan horse so got back to catana
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.53.1,there they found the salaminia come from athens for alcibiades with orders for him to sail home to answer the charges which the state brought against him and for certain others of the soldiers who with him were accused of sacrilege in the matter of the mysteries and of the hermae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.53.2,for the athenians after the departure of the expedition had continued as active as ever in investigating the facts of the mysteries and of the hermae and instead of testing the informers in their suspicious temper welcomed all indifferently arresting and imprisoning the best citizens upon the evidence of rascals and preferring to sift the matter to the bottom sooner than to let an accused person of good character pass unquestioned owing to the rascality of the informer
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.53.3,the commons had heard how oppressive the tyranny of pisistratus and his sons had become before it ended and further that that tyranny had been put down at last not by themselves and harmodius but by the lacedaemonians and so were always in fear and took everything suspiciously
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.54.1,indeed the daring action of aristogiton and harmodius was undertaken in consequence of a love affair which i shall relate at some length to show that the athenians are not more accurate than the rest of the world in their accounts of their own tyrants and of the facts of their own history
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.54.2,pisistratus dying at an advanced age in possession of the tyranny was succeeded by his eldest son hippias and not hipparchus as is vulgarly believed harmodius was then in the flower of youthful beauty and aristogiton a citizen in the middle rank of life was his lover and possessed him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.54.3,solicited without success by hipparchus son of pisistratus harmodius told aristogiton and the enraged lover afraid that the powerful hipparchus might take harmodius by force immediately formed a design such as his condition in life permitted for overthrowing the tyranny
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.54.4,in the meantime hipparchus after a second solicitation of harmodius attended with no better success unwilling to use violence arranged to insult him in some covert way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.54.5,indeed generally their government was not grievous to the multitude or in any way odious in practice and these tyrants cultivated wisdom and virtue as much as any and without exacting from the athenians more than a twentieth of their income splendidly adorned their city and carried on their wars and provided sacrifices for the temples

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.54.7,the athenian people afterwards built on to and lengthened the altar in the marketplace and obliterated the inscription but that in the pythian precinct can still be seen though in faded letters and is to the following effect pisistratus the son of hippias set up this record of his archonshipin precinct of apollo pythias
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.55.1,that hippias was the eldest son and succeeded to the government is what i positively assert as a fact upon which i have had more exact accounts than others and may be also ascertained by the following circumstance he is the only one of the legitimate brothers that appears to have had children as the altar shows and the pillar placed in the athenian acropolis commemorating the crime of the tyrants which mentions no child of thessalus or of hipparchus but five of hippias which he had by myrrhine daughter of callias son of hyperechides and naturally the eldest would have married first
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.55.2,again his name comes first on the pillar after that of his father and this too is quite natural as he was the eldest after him and the reigning tyrant
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.55.3,nor can i ever believe that hippias would have obtained the tyranny so easily if hipparchus had been in power when he was killed and he hippias had had to establish himself upon the same day but he had no doubt been long accustomed to overawe the citizens and to be obeyed by his mercenaries and thus not only conquered but conquered with ease without experiencing any of the embarrassment of a younger brother unused to the exercise of authority
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.55.4,it was the sad fate which made hipparchus famous that got him also the credit with posterity of having been tyrant
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.56.1,to return to harmodius hipparchus having been repulsed in his solicitations insulted him as he had resolved by first inviting a sister of his a young girl to come and bear a basket in a certain procession and then rejecting her on the plea that she had never been invited at all owing to her unworthiness
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.56.2,if harmodius was indignant at this aristogiton for his sake now became more exasperated than ever and having arranged everything with those who were to join them in the enterprise they only waited for the great feast of the panathenaea the sole day upon which the citizens forming part of the procession could meet together in arms without suspicion aristogiton and harmodius were to begin but were to be supported immediately by their accomplices against the bodyguard
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.56.3,the conspirators were not many for better security besides which they hoped that those not in the plot would be carried away by the example of a few daring spirits and use the arms in their hands to recover their liberty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.57.1,at last the festival arrived and hippias with his bodyguard was outside the city in the ceramicus arranging how the different parts of the procession were to proceed harmodius and aristogiton had already their daggers and were getting ready to act
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.57.2,when seeing one of their accomplices talking familiarly with hippias who was easy of access to every one they took fright and concluded that they were discovered and on the point of being taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.57.3,and eager if possible to be revenged first upon the man who had wronged them and for whom they had undertaken all this risk they rushed as they were within the gates and meeting with hipparchus by the leocorium recklessly fell upon him at once infuriated aristogiton by love and harmodius by insult and smote him and slew him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.57.4,aristogiton escaped the guards at the moment through the crowd running up but was afterwards taken and dispatched in no merciful way harmodius was killed on the spot
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.58.1,when the news was brought to hippias in the ceramicus he at once proceeded not to the scene of action but to the armed men in the procession before they being some distance away knew anything of the matter and composing his features for the occasion so as not to betray himself pointed to a certain spot and bade them repair thither without their arms
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.58.2,they withdrew accordingly fancying he had something to say upon which he told the mercenaries to remove the arms and there and then picked out the men he thought guilty and all found with daggers the shield and spear being the usual weapons for a procession
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.59.1,in this way offended love first led harmodius and aristogiton to conspire and the alarm of the moment to commit the rash action recounted
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.59.2,after this the tyranny pressed harder on the athenians and hippias now grown more fearful put to death many of the citizens and at the same time began to turn his eyes abroad for a refuge in case of revolution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.59.3,thus although an athenian he gave his daughter archedice to a lampsacene aeantides son of the tyrant of lampsacus seeing that they had great influence with darius and there is her tomb in lampsacus with this inscription archedice lies buried in this earth hippias her sire and athens gave her birth unto her bosom pride was never known though daughter wife and sister to the throne
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.59.4,hippias after reigning three years longer over the athenians was deposed in the fourth by the lacedaemonians and the banished alcmaeonidae and went with a safe conduct to sigeum and to aeantides at lampsacus and from thence to king darius from whose court he set out twenty years after in his old age and came with the medes to marathon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.60.1,with these events in their minds and recalling everything they knew by hearsay on the subject the athenian people grew difficult of humour and suspicious of the persons charged in the affair of the mysteries and persuaded that all that had taken place was part of an oligarchical and monarchical conspiracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.60.2,in the state of irritation thus produced many persons of consideration had been already thrown into prison and far from showing any signs of abating public feeling grew daily more savage and more arrests were made until at last one of those in custody thought to be the most guilty of all was induced by a fellowprisoner to make a revelation whether true or not is a matter on which there are two opinions no one having been able either then or since to say for certain who did the deed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.60.3,however this may be the other found arguments to persuade him that even if he had not done it he ought to save himself by gaining a promise of impunity and free the state of its present suspicions as he would be surer of safety if he confessed after promise of impunity than if he denied and were brought to trial
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.60.4,he accordingly made a revelation affecting himself and others in the affair of the hermae and the athenian people glad at last as they supposed to get at the truth and furious until then at not being able to discover those who had conspired against the commons at once let go the informer and all the rest whom he had not denounced and bringing the accused to trial executed as many as were apprehended and condemned to death such as had fled and set a price upon their heads
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.60.5,in this it was after all not clear whether the sufferers had been punished unjustly while in any case the rest of the city received immediate and manifest relief
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.1,to return to alcibiades public feeling was very hostile to him being worked on by the same enemies who had attacked him before he went out and now that the athenians fancied that they had got at the truth of the matter of the hermae they believed more firmly than ever that the affair of the mysteries also in which he was implicated had been contrived by him in the same intention and was connected with the plot against the democracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.2,meanwhile it so happened that just at the time of this agitation a small force of lacedaemonians had advanced as far as the isthmus in pursuance of some scheme with the boeotians it was now thought that this had come by appointment at his instigation and not on account of the boeotians and that if the citizens had not acted on the information received and forestalled them by arresting the prisoners the city would have been betrayed the citizens went so far as to sleep one night armed in the temple of theseus within the walls
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.3,the friends also of alcibiades at argos were just at this time suspected of a design to attack the commons and the argive hostages deposited in the islands were given up by the athenians to the argive people to be put to death upon that account
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.4,in short everywhere something was found to create suspicion against alcibiades it was therefore decided to bring him to trial and execute him and the salaminia was sent to sicily for him and the others named in the information with instructions to order him to come and answer the charges against him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.5,but not to arrest him because they wished to avoid causing any agitation in the army or among the enemy in sicily and above all to retain the services of the mantineans and argives who it was thought had been induced to join by his influence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.6,alcibiades with his own ship and his fellowaccused accordingly sailed off with the salaminia from sicily as though to return to athens and went with her as far as thurii and there they left the ship and disappeared being afraid to go home for trial with such a prejudice existing against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.61.7,the crew of the salaminia stayed some time looking for alcibiades and his companions and at length as they were nowhere to be found set sail and departed alcibiades now an outlaw crossed in a boat not long after from thurii to peloponnese and the athenians passed sentence of death by default upon him and those in his company
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.62.1,the athenian generals left in sicily now divided the armament into two parts and each taking one by lot sailed with the whole for selinus and egesta wishing to know whether the egestaeans would give the money and to look into the question of selinus and ascertain the state of the quarrel between her and egesta
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.62.2,coasting along sicily with the shore on their left on the side towards the tyrrhene gulf they touched at himera the only hellenic city in that part of the island and being refused admission resumed their voyage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.62.3,on their way they took hyccara a petty sicanian seaport nevertheless at war with egesta and making slaves of the inhabitants gave up the town to the egestaeans some of whose horse had joined them after which the army proceeded through the territory of the sicels until it reached catana while the fleet sailed along the coast with the slaves on board
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.62.4,meanwhile nicias sailed straight from hyccara along the coast and went to egesta and after transacting his other business and receiving thirty talents rejoined the forces they now sold their slaves for the sum of one hundred and twenty talents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.62.5,and sailed round to their sicel allies to urge them to send troops and meanwhile went with half their own force to the hostile town of hybla in the territory of gela but did not succeed in taking it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.63.1,summer was now over the winter following the athenians at once began to prepare for moving on syracuse and the syracusans on their side for marching against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.63.2,from the moment when the athenians failed to attack them instantly as they at first feared and expected every day that passed did something to revive their courage and when they saw them sailing far away from them on the other side of sicily and going to hybla only to fail in their attempts to storm it they thought less of them than ever and called upon their generals as the multitude is apt to do in its moments of confidence to lead them to catana since the enemy would not come to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.63.3,parties also of the syracusan horse employed in reconnoitring constantly rode up to the athenian armament and among other insults asked them whether they had not really come to settle with the syracusans in a foreign country rather than to resettle the leontines in their own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.64.1,aware of this the athenian generals determined to draw them out in mass as far as possible from the city and themselves in the meantime to sail by night along shore and take up at their leisure a convenient position this they knew they could not so well do if they had to disembark from their ships in front of a force prepared for them or to go by land openly the numerous cavalry of the syracusans a force which they were themselves without would then be able to do the greatest mischief to their light troops and the crowd that followed them but this plan would enable them to take up a position in which the horse could do them no hurt worth speaking of some syracusan exiles with the army having told them of the spot near the olympieum which they afterwards occupied in pursuance of their idea the generals imagined the following stratagem
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.64.2,they sent to syracuse a man devoted to them and by the syracusan generals thought to be no less in their interest he was a native of catana and said he came from persons in that place whose names the syracusan generals were acquainted with and whom they knew to be among the members of their party still left in the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.64.3,he told them that the athenians passed the night in the town at some distance from their arms and that if the syracusans would name a day and come with all their people at daybreak to attack the armament they their friends would close the gates upon the troops in the city and set fire to the vessels while the syracusans would easily take the camp by an attack upon the stockade in this they would be aided by many of the catanians who were already prepared to act and from whom he himself came
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.65.1,the generals of the syracusans who did not want confidence and who had intended even without this to march on catana believed the man without any sufficient inquiry fixed at once a day upon which they would be there and dismissed him and the selinuntines and others of their allies having now arrived gave orders for all the syracusans to march out in mass their preparations completed and the time fixed for their arrival being at hand they set out for catana and passed the night upon the river symaethus in the leontine territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.65.2,meanwhile the athenians no sooner knew of their approach than they took all their forces and such of the sicels or others as had joined them put them on board their ships and boats and sailed by night to syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.65.3,thus when morning broke the athenians were landing opposite the olympieum ready to seize their camping ground and the syracusan horse having ridden up first to catana and found that all the armament had put to sea turned back and told the infantry and then all turned back together and went to the relief of the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.66.1,in the meantime as the march before the syracusans was a long one the athenians quietly sate down their army in a convenient position where they could begin an engagement when they pleased and where the syracusan cavalry would have least opportunity of annoying them either before or during the action being fenced off on one side by walls houses trees and by a marsh and on the other by cliffs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.66.2,they also felled the neighbouring trees and carried them down to the sea and formed a palisade alongside of their ships and with stones which they picked up and wood hastily raised a fort at daskon the most vulnerable point of their position and broke down the bridge over the anapus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.66.3,these preparations were allowed to go on without any interruption from the city the first hostile force to appear being the syracusan cavalry followed afterwards by all the foot together at first they came close up to the athenian army and then finding that they did not offer to engage crossed the helorine road and encamped for the night
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.67.1,the next day the athenians and their allies prepared for battle their dispositions being as follows their right wing was occupied by the argives and mantineans the centre by the athenians and the rest of the field by the other allies half their army was drawn up eight deep in advance half close to their tents in a hollow square formed also eight deep which had orders to look out and be ready to go to the support of the troops hardest pressed the camp followers were placed inside this reserve
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.67.2,the syracusans meanwhile formed their heavy infantry sixteen deep consisting of the masslevy of their own people and such allies as had joined them the strongest contingent being that of the selinuntines next to them the cavalry of the geloans numbering two hundred in all with about twenty horse and fifty archers from camarina the cavalry was posted on their right full twelve hundred strong and next to it the darters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.67.3,as the athenians were about to begin the attack nicias went along the lines and addressed these words of encouragement to the army and the nations composing it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.68.1,soldiers a long exhortation is little needed by men like ourselves who are here to fight in the same battle the force itself being to my thinking more fit to inspire confidence than a fine speech with a weak army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.68.2,where we have argives mantineans athenians and the first of the islanders in the ranks together it were strange indeed with so many and so brave companions in arms if we did not feel confident of victory especially when we have masslevies opposed to our picked troops and what is more siceliots who may disdain us but will not stand against us their skill not being at all commensurate to their rashness
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.68.3,you may also remember that we are far from home and have no friendly land near except what your own swords shall win you and here i put before you a motive just the reverse of that which the enemy are appealing to their cry being that they shall fight for their country mine that we shall fight for a country that is not ours where we must conquer or hardly get away as we shall have their horse upon us in great numbers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.68.4,remember therefore your renown and go boldly against the enemy thinking the present strait and necessity more terrible than they
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.69.1,after this address nicias at once led on the army the syracusans were not at that moment expecting an immediate engagement and some had even gone away to the town which was close by these now ran up as hard as they could and though behind time took their places here or there in the main body as fast as they joined it want of zeal or daring was certainly not the fault of the syracusans either in this or the other battles but although not inferior in courage so far as their military science might carry them when this failed them they were compelled to give up their resolution also on the present occasion although they had not supposed that the athenians would begin the attack and although constrained to stand upon their defence at short notice they at once took up their arms and advanced to meet them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.69.2,first the stonethrowers slingers and archers of either army began skirmishing and routed or were routed by one another as might be expected between light troops next soothsayers brought forward the usual victims and trumpeters urged on the heavy infantry to the charge
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.69.3,and thus they advanced the syracusans to fight for their country and each individual for his safety that day and liberty hereafter in the enemy s army the athenians to make another s country theirs and to save their own from suffering by their defeat the argives and independent allies to help them in getting what they came for and to earn by victory another sight of the country they had left behind while the subject allies owed most of their ardour to the desire of selfpreservation which they could only hope for if victorious next to which as a secondary motive came the chance of serving on easier terms after helping the athenians to a fresh conquest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.70.1,the armies now came to close quarters and for a long while fought without either giving ground meanwhile there occurred some claps of thunder with lightning and heavy rain which did not fail to add to the fears of the party fighting for the first time and very little acquainted with war while to their more experienced adversaries these phenomena appeared to be produced by the time of year and much more alarm was felt at the continued resistance of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.70.2,at last the argives drove in the syracusan left and after them the athenians routed the troops opposed to them and the syracusan army was thus cut in two and betook itself to flight
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.70.3,the athenians did not pursue far being held in check by the numerous and undefeated syracusan horse who attacked and drove back any of their heavy infantry whom they saw pursuing in advance of the rest in spite of which the victors followed so far as was safe in a body and then went back and set up a trophy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.70.4,meanwhile the syracusans rallied at the helorine road where they reformed as well as they could under the circumstances and even sent a garrison of their own citizens to the olympieum fearing that the athenians might lay hands on some of the treasures there the rest returned to the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.71.1,the athenians however did not go to the temple but collected their dead and laid them upon a pyre and passed the night upon the field the next day they gave the enemy back their dead under truce to the number of about two hundred and sixty syracusans and allies and gathered together the bones of their own some fifty athenians and allies and taking the spoils of the enemy sailed back to catana
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.71.2,it was now winter and it did not seem possible for the moment to carry on the war before syracuse until horse should have been sent for from athens and levied among the allies in sicily to do away with their utter inferiority in cavalry and money should have been collected in the country and received from athens and until some of the cities which they hoped would be now more disposed to listen to them after the battle should have been brought over and corn and all other necessaries provided for a campaign in the spring against syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.72.1,with this intention they sailed off to naxos and catana for the winter meanwhile the syracusans burned their dead and then held an assembly

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.72.3,since their spirit had not been conquered but their want of discipline had done the mischief still they had not been beaten by so much as might have been expected especially as they were one might say novices in the art of war an army of artisans opposed to the most practised soldiers in hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.72.4,what had also done great mischief was the number of the generals there were fifteen of them and the quantity of orders given combined with the disorder and insubordination of the troops but if they were to have a few skilful generals and used this winter in preparing their heavy infantry finding arms for such as had not got any so as to make them as numerous as possible and forcing them to attend to their training generally they would have every chance of beating their adversaries courage being already theirs and discipline in the field having thus been added to it indeed both these qualities would improve since danger would exercise them in discipline while their courage would be led to surpass itself by the confidence which skill inspires
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.72.5,the generals should be few and elected with full powers and an oath should be taken to leave them entire discretion in their command if they adopted this plan their secrets would be better kept all preparations would be properly made and there would be no room for excuses

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.75.1,during the winter the syracusans built a wall on to the city so as to take in the statue of apollo temenites all along the side looking towards epipolae to make the task of circumvallation longer and more difficult in case of their being defeated and also erected a fort at megara and another in the olympieum and stuck palisades along the sea wherever there was a landing place

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.75.4,hermocrates with some others accordingly arrived at camarina from syracuse and euphemus and others from the athenians and an assembly of the camarinaeans having been convened hermocrates spoke as follows in the hope of prejudicing them against the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.76.1,camarinaeans we did not come on this embassy because we were afraid of your being frightened by the actual forces of the athenians but rather of your being gained by what they would say to you before you heard anything from us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.76.2,they are come to sicily with the pretext that you know and the intention which we all suspect in my opinion less to restore the leontines to their homes than to oust us from ours as it is out of all reason that they should restore in sicily the cities that they lay waste in hellas or should cherish the leontine chalcidians because of their ionian blood and keep in servitude the euboean chalcidians of whom the leontines are a colony
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.76.3,no but the same policy which has proved so successful in hellas is now being tried in sicily after being chosen as the leaders of the ionians and of the other allies of athenian origin to punish the mede the athenians accused some of failure in military service some of fighting against each other and others as the case might be upon any colourable pretext that could be found until they thus subdued them all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.76.4,in fine in the struggle against the medes the athenians did not fight for the liberty of the hellenes or the hellenes for their own liberty but the former to make their countrymen serve them instead of him the latter to change one master for another wiser indeed than the first but wiser for evil
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.77.1,but we are not now come to declare to an audience familiar with them the misdeeds of a state so open to accusation as is the athenian but much rather to blame ourselves who with the warnings we possess in the hellenes in those parts that have been enslaved through not supporting each other and seeing the same sophisms being now tried upon ourselves such as restorations of leontine kinsfolk and support of egestaean allies do not stand together and resolutely show them that here are no ionians or hellespontines or islanders who change continually but always serve a master sometimes the mede and sometimes some other but free dorians from independent peloponnese dwelling in sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.77.2,or are we waiting until we be taken in detail one city after another knowing as we do that in no other way can we be conquered and seeing that they turn to this plan so as to divide some of us by words to draw some by the bait of an alliance into open war with each other and to ruin others by such flattery as different circumstances may render acceptable and do we fancy when destruction first overtakes a distant fellowcountryman that the danger will not come to each of us also or that he who suffers before us will suffer in himself alone
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.78.1,as for the camarinaean who says that it is the syracusan not he that is the enemy of the athenian and who thinks it hard to have to encounter risk in behalf of my country i would have him bear in mind that he will fight in my country not more for mine than for his own and by so much the more safely in that he will enter on the struggle not alone after the way has been cleared by my ruin but with me as his ally and that the object of the athenian is not so much to punish the enmity of the syracusan as to use me as a blind to secure the friendship of the camarinaean
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.78.2,as for him who envies or even fears us and envied and feared great powers must always be and who on this account wishes syracuse to be humbled to teach us a lesson but would still have her survive in the interest of his own security the wish that he indulges is not humanly possible a man can control his own desires but he cannot likewise control circumstances
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.78.3,and in the event of his calculations proving mistaken he may live to bewail his own misfortune and wish to be again envying my prosperity an idle wish if he now sacrifice us and refuse to take his share of perils which are the same in reality though not in name for him as for us what is nominally the preservation of our power being really his own salvation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.78.4,it was to be expected that you of all people in the world camarinaeans being our immediate neighbours and the next in danger would have foreseen this and instead of supporting us in the lukewarm way that you are now doing would rather come to us of your own accord and be now offering at syracuse the aid which you would have asked for at camarina if to camarina the athenians had first come to encourage us to resist the invader neither you however nor the rest have as yet bestirred yourselves in this direction
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.79.1,fear perhaps will make you study to do right both by us and by the invaders and plead that you have an alliance with the athenians but you made that alliance not against your friends but against the enemies that might attack you and to help the athenians when they were wronged by others not when as now they are wronging their neighbours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.79.2,even the rhegians chalcidians though they be refuse to help to restore the chalcidian leontines and it would be strange if while they suspect the gist of this fine pretence and are wise without reason you with every reason on your side should yet choose to assist your natural enemies and should join with their direst foes in undoing those whom nature has made your own kinsfolk
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.79.3,this is not to do right but you should help us without fear of their armament which has no terrors if we hold together but only if we let them succeed in their endeavours to separate us since even after attacking us by ourselves and being victorious in battle they had to go off without effecting their purpose
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.80.1,united therefore we have no cause to despair but rather new encouragement to league together especially as succors will come to us from the peloponnesians in military matters the undoubted superiors of the athenians and you need not think that your prudent policy of taking sides with neither because allies of both is either safe for you or fair to us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.80.2,practically it is not as fair as it pretends to be if the vanquished be defeated and the victor conquer through your refusing to join what is the effect of your abstention but to leave the former to perish unaided and to allow the latter to offend unhindered and yet it were more honourable to join those who are not only the injured party but your own kindred and by so doing to defend the common interests of sicily and save your friends the athenians from doing wrong
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.80.3,in conclusion we syracusans say that it is useless for us to demonstrate either to you or to the rest what you know already as well as we do but we entreat and if our entreaty fail we protest that we are menaced by our eternal enemies the ionians and are betrayed by you our fellow dorians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.80.4,if the athenians reduce us they will owe their victory to your decision but in their own name will reap the honour and will receive as the prize of their triumph the very men who enabled them to gain it on the other hand if we are the conquerors you will have to pay for having been the cause of our danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.80.5,consider therefore and now make your choice between the security which present servitude offers and the prospect of conquering with us and so escaping disgraceful submission to an athenian master and avoiding the lasting enmity of syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.81.1,such were the words of hermocrates after whom euphemus the athenian ambassador spoke as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.82.1,although we came here only to renew the former alliance the attack of the syracusans compels us to speak of our empire and of the good right we have to it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.82.2,the best proof of this the speaker himself furnished when he called the ionians eternal enemies of the dorians it is the fact and the peloponnesian dorians being our superiors in numbers and next neighbours we ionians looked out for the best means of escaping their domination
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.82.3,after the median war we had a fleet and so got rid of the empire and supremacy of the lacedaemonians who had no right to give orders to us more than we to them except that of being the strongest at that moment and being appointed leaders of the king s former subjects we continue to be so thinking that we are least likely to fall under the dominion of the peloponnesians if we have a force to defend ourselves with and in strict truth having done nothing unfair in reducing to subjection the ionians and islanders the kinsfolk whom the syracusans say we have enslaved
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.82.4,they our kinsfolk came against their mother country that is to say against us together with the mede and instead of having the courage to revolt and sacrifice their property as we did when we abandoned our city chose to be slaves themselves and to try to make us so
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.83.1,we therefore deserve to rule because we placed the largest fleet and an unflinching patriotism at the service of the hellenes and because these our subjects did us mischief by their ready subservience to the medes and desert apart we seek to strengthen ourselves against the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.83.2,we make no fine professions of having a right to rule because we overthrew the barbarian singlehanded or because we risked what we did risk for the freedom of the subjects in question any more than for that of all and for our own no one can be quarrelled with for providing for his proper safety if we are now here in sicily it is equally in the interest of our security with which we perceive that your interest also coincides
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.83.3,we prove this from the conduct which the syracusans cast against us and which you somewhat too timorously suspect knowing that those whom fear has made suspicious may be carried away by the charm of eloquence for the moment but when they come to act follow their interests
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.83.4,now as we have said fear makes us hold our empire in hellas and fear makes us now come with the help of our friends to order safely matters in sicily and not to enslave any but rather to prevent any from being enslaved
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.84.1,meanwhile let no one imagine that we are interesting ourselves in you without your having anything to do with us seeing that if you are preserved and able to make head against the syracusans they will be less likely to harm us by sending troops to the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.84.2,in this way you have everything to do with us and on this account it is perfectly reasonable for us to restore the leontines and to make them not subjects like their kinsmen in euboea but as powerful as possible to help us by annoying the syracusans from their frontier
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.84.3,in hellas we are alone a match for our enemies and as for the assertion that it is out of all reason that we should free the sicilian while we enslave the chalcidian the fact is that the latter is useful to us by being without arms and contributing money only while the former the leontines and our other friends cannot be too independent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.85.1,besides for tyrants and imperial cities nothing is unreasonable if expedient no one a kinsman unless sure but friendship or enmity is everywhere an affair of time and circumstance here in sicily our interest is not to weaken our friends but by means of their strength to cripple our enemies why doubt this in hellas we treat our allies as we find them useful
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.85.2,the chians and methymnians govern themselves and furnish ships most of the rest have harder terms and pay tribute in money while others although islanders and easy for us to take are free altogether because they occupy convenient positions round peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.85.3,in our settlement of the states here in sicily we should therefore naturally be guided by our interest and by fear as we say of the syracusans their ambition is to rule you their object to use the suspicions that we excite to unite you and then when we have gone away without effecting anything by force or through your isolation to become the masters of sicily and masters they must become if you unite with them as a force of that magnitude would be no longer easy for us to deal with united and they would be more than a match for you as soon as we were away
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.86.1,any other view of the case is condemned by the facts when you first asked us over the fear which you held out was that of danger to athens if we let you come under the dominion of syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.86.2,and it is not right now to mistrust the very same argument by which you claimed to convince us or to give way to suspicion because we are come with a larger force against the power of that city those whom you should really distrust are the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.86.3,we are not able to stay here without you and if we proved perfidious enough to bring you into subjection we should be unable to keep you in bondage owing to the length of the voyage and the difficulty of guarding large and in a military sense continental towns they the syracusans live close to you not in a camp but in a city greater than the force we have with us plot always against you never let slip an opportunity once offered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.86.4,as they have shown in the case of the leontines and others and now have the face just as if you were fools to invite you to aid them against the power that hinders this and that has thus far maintained sicily independent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.86.5,we as against them invite you to a much more real safety when we beg you not to betray that common safety which we each have in the other and to reflect that they even without allies will by their numbers have always the way open to you while you will not often have the opportunity of defending yourselves with such numerous auxiliaries if through your suspicions you once let these go away unsuccessful or defeated you will wish to see if only a handful of them back again when the day is past in which their presence could do anything for you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.87.1,but we hope camarinaeans that the calumnies of the syracusans will not be allowed to succeed either with you or with the rest we have told you the whole truth upon the things we are suspected of and will now briefly recapitulate in the hope of convincing you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.87.2,we assert that we are rulers in hellas in order not to be subjects liberators in sicily that we may not be harmed by the sicilians that we are compelled to interfere in many things because we have many things to guard against and that now as before we are come as allies to those of you who suffer wrong in this island not without invitation but upon invitation
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.87.3,accordingly instead of making yourselves judges or censors of our conduct and trying to turn us which it were now difficult to do so far as there is anything in our interfering policy or in our character that chimes in with your interest this take and make use of and be sure that far from being injurious to all alike to most of the hellenes that policy is even beneficial
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.87.4,thanks to it all men in all places even where we are not who either apprehend or meditate aggression from the near prospect before them in the one case of obtaining our intervention in their favour in the other of our arrival making the venture dangerous find themselves constrained respectively to be moderate against their will and to be preserved without trouble of their own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.87.5,do not you reject this security that is open to all who desire it and is now offered to you but do like others and instead of being always on the defensive against the syracusans unite with us and in your turn at last threaten them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.1,such were the words of euphemus what the camarinaeans felt was this sympathising with the athenians except in so far as they might be afraid of their subjugating sicily they had always been at enmity with their neighbour syracuse from the very fact however that they were their neighbours they feared the syracusans most of the two and being apprehensive of their conquering even without them both sent them in the first instance the few horsemen mentioned and for the future determined to support them most in fact although as sparingly as possible but for the moment in order not to seem to slight the athenians especially as they had been successful in the engagement to answer both alike
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.2,agreeably to this resolution they answered that as both the contending parties happened to be allies of theirs they thought it most consistent with their oaths at present to side with neither with which answer the ambassadors of either party departed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.3,in the meantime while syracuse pursued her preparations for war the athenians were encamped at naxos and tried by negotiation to gain as many of the sicels as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.4,those more in the low lands and subjects of syracuse mostly held aloof but the peoples of the interior who had never been otherwise than independent with few exceptions at once joined the athenians and brought down corn to the army and in some cases even money
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.5,the athenians marched against those who refused to join and forced some of them to do so in the case of others they were stopped by the syracusans sending garrisons and reinforcements meanwhile the athenians moved their winter quarters from naxos to catana and reconstructed the camp burnt by the syracusans and stayed there the rest of the winter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.6,they also sent a galley to carthage with proffers of friendship on the chance of obtaining assistance and another to tyrrhenia some of the cities there having spontaneously offered to join them in the war they also sent round to the sicels and to egesta desiring them to send them as many horses as possible and meanwhile prepared bricks iron and all other things necessary for the work of circumvallation intending by the spring to begin hostilities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.7,in the meantime the syracusan envoys despatched to corinth and lacedaemon tried as they passed along the coast to persuade the italiots to interfere with the proceedings of the athenians which threatened italy quite as much as syracuse and having arrived at corinth made a speech calling on the corinthians to assist them on the ground of their common origin
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.8,the corinthians voted at once to aid them heart and soul themselves and then sent on envoys with them to lacedaemon to help them to persuade her also to prosecute the war with the athenians more openly at home and to send succors to sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.9,the envoys from corinth having reached lacedaemon found there alcibiades with his fellowrefugees who had at once crossed over in a trading vessel from thurii first to cyllene in elis and afterwards from thence to lacedaemon upon the lacedaemonians own invitation after first obtaining a safe conduct as he feared them for the part he had taken in the affair of mantinea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.88.10,the result was that the corinthians syracusans and alcibiades pressing all the same request in the assembly of the lacedaemonians succeeded in persuading them but as the ephors and the authorities although resolved to send envoys to syracuse to prevent their surrendering to the athenians showed no disposition to send them any assistance alcibiades now came forward and inflamed and stirred the lacedaemonians by speaking as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.89.1,i am forced first to speak to you of the prejudice with which i am regarded in order that suspicion may not make you disinclined to listen to me upon public matters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.89.2,the connection with you as your proxeni which the ancestors of our family by reason of some discontent renounced i personally tried to renew by my good offices towards you in particular upon the occasion of the disaster at pylos but although i maintained this friendly attitude you yet chose to negotiate the peace with the athenians through my enemies and thus to strengthen them and to discredit me
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.89.3,you had therefore no right to complain if i turned to the mantineans and argives and seized other occasions of thwarting and injuring you and the time has now come when those among you who in the bitterness of the moment may have been then unfairly angry with me should look at the matter in its true light and take a different view those again who judged me unfavourably because i leaned rather to the side of the commons must not think that their dislike is any better founded
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.89.4,we have always been hostile to tyrants and all who oppose arbitrary power are called commons hence we continued to act as leaders of the multitude besides which as democracy was the government of the city it was necessary in most things to conform to established conditions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.89.5,however we endeavoured to be more moderate than the licentious temper of the times and while there were others formerly as now who tried to lead the multitude astray the same who banished me
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.89.6,our party was that of the whole people our creed being to do our part in preserving the form of government under which the city enjoyed the utmost greatness and freedom and which we had found existing as for democracy the men of sense among us knew what it was and i perhaps as well as any as i have the more cause to complain of it but there is nothing new to be said of a patent absurdity meanwhile we did not think it safe to alter it under the pressure of your hostility
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.90.1,so much then for the prejudices with which i am regarded i now can call your attention to the questions you must consider and upon which superior knowledge perhaps permits me to speak
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.90.2,we sailed to sicily first to conquer if possible the siceliots and after them the italiots also and finally to assail the empire and city of carthage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.90.3,in the event of all or most of these schemes succeeding we were then to attack peloponnese bringing with us the entire force of the hellenes lately acquired in those parts and taking a number of barbarians into our pay such as the iberians and others in those countries confessedly the most warlike known and building numerous galleys in addition to those which we had already timber being plentiful in italy and with this fleet blockading peloponnese from the sea and assailing it with our armies by land taking some of the cities by storm drawing works of circumvallation round others we hoped without difficulty to effect its reduction and after this to rule the whole of the hellenic name
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.90.4,money and corn meanwhile for the better execution of these plans were to be supplied in sufficient quantities by the newly acquired places in those countries independently of our revenues here at home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.1,you have thus heard the history of the present expedition from the man who most exactly knows what our objects were and the remaining generals will if they can carry these out just the same but that the states in sicily must succumb if you do not help them i will now show
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.2,although the siceliots with all their inexperience might even now be saved if their forces were united the syracusans alone beaten already in one battle with all their people and blockaded from the sea will be unable to withstand the athenian armament that is now there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.3,but if syracuse falls all sicily falls also and italy immediately afterwards and the danger which i just now spoke of from that quarter will before long be upon you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.4,none need therefore fancy that sicily only is in question peloponnese will be so also unless you speedily do as i tell you and send on board ship to syracuse troops that shall be able to row their ships themselves and serve as heavy infantry the moment that they land and what i consider even more important than the troops a spartan as commanding officer to discipline the forces already on foot and to compel recusants to serve the friends that you have already will thus become more confident and the waverers will be encouraged to join you
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.5,meanwhile you must carry on the war here more openly that the syracusans seeing that you do not forget them may put heart into their resistance and that the athenians may be less able to reinforce their armament
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.6,you must fortify decelea in attica the blow of which the athenians are always most afraid and the only one that they think they have not experienced in the present war the surest method of harming an enemy being to find out what he most fears and to choose this means of attacking him since every one naturally knows best his own weak points and fears accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.91.7,the fortification in question while it benefits you will create difficulties for your adversaries of which i shall pass over many and shall only mention the chief whatever property there is in the country will most of it become yours either by capture or surrender and the athenians will at once be deprived of their revenues from the silver mines at laurium of their present gains from their land and from the law courts and above all of the revenue from their allies which will be paid less regularly as they lose their awe of athens and see you addressing yourselves with vigour to the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.92.1,the zeal and speed with which all this shall be done depends lacedaemonians upon yourselves as to its possibility i am quite confident and i have little fear of being mistaken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.92.2,meanwhile i hope that none of you will think any the worse of me if after having hitherto passed as a lover of my country i now actively join its worst enemies in attacking it or will suspect what i say as the fruit of an outlaw s enthusiasm
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.92.3,i am an outlaw from the iniquity of those who drove me forth not if you will be guided by me from your service my worst enemies are not you who only harmed your foes but they who forced their friends to become enemies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.92.4,and love of country is what i do not feel when i am wronged but what i felt when secure in my rights as a citizen indeed i do not consider that i am now attacking a country that is still mine i am rather trying to recover one that is mine no longer and the true lover of his country is not he who consents to lose it unjustly rather than attack it but he who longs for it so much that he will go all lengths to recover it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.92.5,for myself therefore lacedaemonians i beg you to use me without scruple for danger and trouble of every kind and to remember the argument in every one s mouth that if i did you great harm as an enemy i could likewise do you good service as a friend inasmuch as i know the plans of the athenians while i only guessed yours for yourselves i entreat you to believe that your most capital interests are now under deliberation and i urge you to send without hesitation the expeditions to sicily and attica by the presence of a small part of your forces you will save important cities in that island and you will destroy the power of athens both present and prospective after this you will dwell in security and enjoy the supremacy over all hellas resting not on force but upon consent and affection

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.93.2,accordingly they now turned their attention to the fortifying of decelea and sending immediate aid to the sicilians and naming gylippus son of cleandridas to the command of the syracusans bade him consult with that people and with the corinthians and arrange for succors reaching the island in the best and speediest way possible under the circumstances
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.93.3,gylippus desired the corinthians to send him at once two ships to asine and to prepare the rest that they intended to send and to have them ready to sail at the proper time having settled this the envoys departed from lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.93.4,in the meantime arrived the athenian galley from sicily sent by the generals for money and cavalry and the athenians after hearing what they wanted voted to send the supplies for the armament and the cavalry and the winter ended and with it ended the seventeenth year of the present war of which thucydides is the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.94.1,the next summer at the very beginning of the season the athenians in sicily put out from catana and sailed along shore to megara in sicily from which as i have mentioned above the syracusans expelled the inhabitants in the time of their tyrant gelo themselves occupying the territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.94.2,here the athenians landed and laid waste the country and after an unsuccessful attack upon a fort of the syracusans went on with the fleet and army to the river terias and advancing inland laid waste the plain and set fire to the corn and after killing some of a small syracusan party which they encountered and setting up a trophy went back again to their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.94.3,they now sailed to catana and took in provisions there and going with their whole force against centoripa a town of the sicels acquired it by capitulation and departed after also burning the corn of the inessaens and hybleans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.94.4,upon their return to catana they found the horsemen arrived from athens to the number of two hundred and fifty with their equipments but without their horses which were to be procured upon the spot and thirty mounted archers and three hundred talents of silver
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.95.1,the same spring the lacedaemonians marched against argos and went as far as cleonae when an earthquake occurred and caused them to return after this the argives invaded the thyreatid which is on their border and took much booty from the lacedaemonians which was sold for no less than twentyfive talents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.95.2,the same summer not long after the thespian commons made an attack upon the party in office which was not successful but succors arrived from thebes and some were caught while others took refuge at athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.96.1,the same summer the syracusans learned that the athenians had been joined by their cavalry and were on the point of marching against them and seeing that without becoming masters of epipolae a precipitous spot situated exactly over the town the athenians could not even if victorious in battle easily invest them they determined to guard its approaches in order that the enemy might not ascend unobserved by this the sole way by which ascent was possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.96.2,as the remainder is lofty ground and falls right down to the city and can all be seen from inside and as it lies above the rest the place is called by the syracusans epipolae or overtown
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.96.3,they accordingly went out in mass at daybreak into the meadow along the river anapus their new generals hermocrates and his colleagues having just come into office and held a review of their heavy infantry from whom they first selected a picked body of six hundred under the command of diomilus an exile from andros to guard epipolae and to be ready to muster at a moment s notice to help wherever help should be required
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.97.1,meanwhile the athenians the very same morning were holding a review having already made land unobserved with all the armament from catana opposite a place called leon not much more than half a mile from epipolae where they disembarked their army bringing the fleet to anchor at thapsus a peninsula running out into the sea with a narrow isthmus and not far from the city of syracuse either by land or water
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.97.2,while the naval force of the athenians threw a stockade across the isthmus and remained quiet at thapsus the land army immediately went on at a run to epipolae and succeeded in getting up by euryelus before the syracusans perceived them or could come up from the meadow and the review
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.97.3,diomilus with his six hundred and the rest advanced as quickly as they could but they had nearly three miles to go from the meadow before reaching them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.97.4,attacking in this way in considerable disorder the syracusans were defeated in battle at epipolae and retired to the town with a loss of about three hundred killed and diomilus among the number
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.97.5,after this the athenians set up a trophy and restored to the syracusans their dead under truce and next day descended to syracuse itself and no one coming out to meet them reascended and built a fort at labdalum upon the edge of the cliffs of epipolae looking towards megara to serve as a magazine for their baggage and money whenever they advanced to give battle or to work at the lines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.98.1,not long afterwards three hundred cavalry came to them from egesta and about a hundred from the sicels naxians and others and thus with the two hundred and fifty from athens for whom they had got horses from the egestaeans and catanians besides others that they bought they now mustered six hundred and fifty cavalry in all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.98.2,after posting a garrison in labdalum they advanced to syca where they sate down and quickly built the circle or centre of their wall of circumvallation the syracusans appalled at the rapidity with which the work advanced determined to go out against them and give battle and interrupt it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.98.3,and the two armies were already in battle array when the syracusan generals observed that their troops found such difficulty in getting into line and were in such disorder that they led them back into the town except part of the cavalry these remained and hindered the athenians from carrying stones or dispersing to any great distance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.98.4,until a tribe of the athenian heavy infantry with all the cavalry charged and routed the syracusan horse with some loss after which they set up a trophy for the cavalry action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.99.1,the next day the athenians began building the wall to the north of the circle at the same time collecting stone and timber which they kept laying down towards trogilus along the shortest line for their works from the great harbour to the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.99.2,while the syracusans guided by their generals and above all by hermocrates instead of risking any more general engagements determined to build a counterwork in the direction in which the athenians were going to carry their wall if this could be completed in time the enemy s lines would be cut and meanwhile if he were to attempt to interrupt them by an attack they would send a part of their forces against him and would secure the approaches beforehand with their stockade while the athenians would have to leave off working with their whole force in order to attend to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.99.3,they accordingly sallied forth and began to build starting from their city running a cross wall below the athenian circle cutting down the olives and erecting wooden towers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.99.4,as the athenian fleet had not yet sailed round into the great harbour the syracusans still commanded the seacoast and the athenians brought their provisions by land from thapsus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.100.1,the syracusans now thought the stockades and stonework of their counterwall sufficiently far advanced and as the athenians afraid of being divided and so fighting at a disadvantage and intent upon their own wall did not come out to interrupt them they left one tribe to guard the new work and went back into the city meanwhile the athenians destroyed their pipes of drinkingwater carried underground into the city and watching until the rest of the syracusans were in their tents at midday and some even gone away into the city and those in the stockade keeping but indifferent guard appointed three hundred picked men of their own and some men picked from the light troops and armed for the purpose to run suddenly as fast as they could to the counterwork while the rest of the army advanced in two divisions the one with one of the generals to the city in case of a sortie the other with the other general to the stockade by the postern gate
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.100.2,the three hundred attacked and took the stockade abandoned by its garrison who took refuge in the outworks round the statue of apollo temenites here the pursuers burst in with them and after getting in were beaten out by the syracusans and some few of the argives and athenians slain
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.100.3,after which the whole army retired and having demolished the counterwork and pulled up the stockade carried away the stakes to their own lines and set up a trophy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.101.1,the next day the athenians from the circle proceeded to fortify the cliff above the marsh which on this side of epipolae looks towards the great harbour this being also the shortest line for their work to go down across the plain and the marsh to the harbour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.101.2,meanwhile the syracusans marched out and began a second stockade starting from the city across the middle of the marsh digging a trench alongside to make it impossible for the athenians to carry their wall down to the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.101.3,as soon as the athenians had finished their work at the cliff they again attacked the stockade and ditch of the syracusans ordering the fleet to sail round from thapsus into the great harbour of syracuse they descended at about dawn from epipolae into the plain and laying doors and planks over the marsh where it was muddy and firmest crossed over on these and by daybreak took the ditch and the stockade except a small portion which they captured afterwards
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.101.4,a battle now ensued in which the athenians were victorious the right wing of the syracusans flying to the town and the left to the river the three hundred picked athenians wishing to cut off their passage pressed on at a run to the bridge
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.101.5,when the alarmed syracusans who had with them most of their cavalry closed and routed them hurling them back upon the athenian right wing the first tribe of which was thrown into a panic by the shock
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.101.6,seeing this lamachus came to their aid from the athenian left with a few archers and with the argives and crossing a ditch was left alone with a few that had crossed with him and was killed with five or six of his men these the syracusans managed immediately to snatch up in haste and get across the river into a place of security themselves retreating as the rest of the athenian army now came up
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.102.1,meanwhile those who had at first fled for refuge to the city seeing the turn affairs were taking now rallied from the town and formed against the athenians in front of them sending also a part of their number to the circle on epipolae which they hoped to take while denuded of its defenders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.102.2,these took and destroyed the athenian outwork of a thousand feet the circle itself being saved by nicias who happened to have been left in it through illness and who now ordered the servants to set fire to the engines and timber thrown down before the wall want of men as he was aware rendering all other means of escape impossible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.102.3,this step was justified by the result the syracusans not coming any further on account of the fire but retreating meanwhile succors were coming up from the athenians below who had put to flight the troops opposed to them and the fleet also according to orders was sailing from thapsus into the great harbour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.102.4,seeing this the troops on the heights retired in haste and the whole army of the syracusans reentered the city thinking that with their present force they would no longer be able to hinder the wall reaching the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.103.1,after this the athenians set up a trophy and restored to the syracusans their dead under truce receiving in return lamachus and those who had fallen with him the whole of their forces naval and military being now with them they began from epipolae and the cliffs and enclosed the syracusans with a double wall down to the sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.103.2,provisions were now brought in for the armament from all parts of italy and many of the sicels who had hitherto been looking to see how things went came as allies to the athenians there also arrived three ships of fifty oars from tyrrhenia meanwhile everything else progressed favourably for their hopes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.103.3,the syracusans began to despair of finding safety in arms no relief having reached them from peloponnese and were now proposing terms of capitulation among themselves and to nicias who after the death of lamachus was left sole commander
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.103.4,no decision was come to but as was natural with men in difficulties and besieged more straitly than before there was much discussion with nicias and still more in the town their present misfortunes had also made them suspicious of one another and the blame of their disasters was thrown upon the illfortune or treachery of the generals under whose command they had happened and these were deposed and others heraclides eucles and tellias elected in their stead
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.104.1,meanwhile the lacedaemonian gylippus and the ships from corinth were now off leucas intent upon going with all haste to the relief of sicily the reports that reached them being of an alarming kind and all agreeing in the falsehood that syracuse was already completely invested gylippus abandoned all hope of sicily and wishing to save italy rapidly crossed the ionian sea to tarentum with the corinthian pythen two laconian and two corinthian vessels leaving the corinthians to follow him after manning in addition to their own ten two leucadian and two ambraciot ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.104.2,from tarentum gylippus first went on an embassy to thurii and claimed anew the rights of citizenship which his father had enjoyed failing to bring over the townspeople he weighed anchor and coasted along italy opposite the terinaean gulf he was caught by the wind which blows violently and steadily from the north in that quarter and was carried out to sea and after experiencing very rough weather remade tarentum where he hauled ashore and refitted such of his ships as had suffered most from the tempest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.104.3,nicias heard of his approach but like the thurians despised the scanty number of his ships and set down piracy as the only probable object of the voyage and so took no precautions for the present
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.105.1,about the same time in this summer the lacedaemonians invaded argos with their allies and laid waste most of the country the athenians went with thirty ships to the relief of the argives thus breaking their treaty with the lacedaemonians in the most overt manner
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.105.2,up to this time incursions from pylos descents on the coasts of the rest of peloponnese instead of on the laconian had been the extent of their cooperation with the argives and mantineans and although the argives had often begged them to land if only for a moment with their heavy infantry in laconia lay waste ever so little of it with them and depart they had always refused to do so now however under the command of pythodorus laespodius and demaratus they landed at epidaurus limera prasiae and other places and plundered the country and thus furnished the lacedaemonians with a better pretext for hostilities against athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:6.105.3,after the athenians had retired from argos with their fleet and the lacedaemonians also the argives made an incursion into the phliasid and returned home after ravaging their land and killing some of the inhabitants
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.1.1,after refitting their ships gylippus and pythen coasted along from tarentum to epizephyrian locris they now received the more correct information that syracuse was not yet completely invested but that it was still possible for an army arriving by epipolae to effect an entrance and they consulted accordingly whether they should keep sicily on their right and risk sailing in by sea or leaving it on their left should first sail to himera and taking with them the himeraeans and any others that might agree to join them go to syracuse by land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.1.2,finally they determined to sail for himera especially as the four athenian ships which nicias had at length sent off on hearing that they were at locris had not yet arrived at rhegium accordingly before these reached their post the peloponnesians crossed the strait and after touching at rhegium and messina came to himera
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.1.3,arrived there they persuaded the himeraeans to join in the war and not only to go with them themselves but to provide arms for the seamen from their vessels which they had drawn ashore at himera and they sent and appointed a place for the selinuntines to meet them with all their forces
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.1.4,a few troops were also promised by the geloans and some of the sicels who were now ready to join them with much greater alacrity owing to the recent death of archonidas a powerful sicel king in that neighborhood and friendly to athens and owing also to the vigor shown by gylippus in coming from lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.1.5,gylippus now took with him about seven hundred of his sailors and marines that number only having arms a thousand heavy infantry and light troops from himera with a body of a hundred horse some light troops and cavalry from selinus a few geloans and sicels numbering a thousand in all and set out on his march for syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.2.1,meanwhile the corinthian fleet from leucas made all haste to arrive and one of their commanders gongylus starting last with a single ship was the first to reach syracuse a little before gylippus gongylus found the syracusans on the point of holding an assembly to consider whether they should not put an end to the war this he prevented and reassured them by telling them that more vessels were still to arrive and that gylippus son of cleandridas had been despatched by the lacedaemonians to take the command
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.2.2,upon this the syracusans took courage and immediately marched out with all their forces to meet gylippus who they found was now close at hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.2.3,meanwhile gylippus after taking ietae a fort of the sicels on his way formed his army in order of battle and so arrived at epipolae and ascending by euryelus as the athenians had done at first now advanced with the syracusans against the athenian lines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.2.4,his arrival chanced at a critical moment the athenians had already finished a double wall of six or seven furlongs to the great harbor with the exception of a small portion next to the sea which they were still engaged upon and in the remainder of the circle towards trogilus on the other sea stones had been laid ready for building for the greater part of the distance and some points had been left half finished while others were entirely completed the danger of syracuse had indeed been great
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.3.1,meanwhile the athenians recovering from the confusion into which they had been at first thrown by the sudden approach of gylippus and the syracusans formed in order of battle gylippus halted at a short distance off and sent on a herald to tell them that if they would evacuate sicily with bag and baggage within five days time he was willing to make a truce accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.3.2,the athenians treated this proposition with contempt and dismissed the herald without an answer after this both sides began to prepare for action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.3.3,gylippus observing that the syracusans were in disorder and did not easily fall into line drew off his troops more into the open ground while nicias did not lead on the athenians but lay still by his own wall when gylippus saw that they did not come on he led off his army to the citadel of the quarter of apollo temenites and passed the night there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.3.4,on the following day he led out the main body of his army and drawing them up in order of battle before the walls of the athenians to prevent their going to the relief of any other quarter despatched a strong force against fort labdalum and took it and put all whom he found in it to the sword the place not being within sight of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.3.5,on the same day an athenian galley that lay moored off the harbor was captured by the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.1,after this the syracusans and their allies began to carry a single wall starting from the city in a slanting direction up epipolae in order that the athenians unless they could hinder the work might be no longer able to invest them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.2,meanwhile the athenians having now finished their wall down to the sea had come up to the heights and part of their wall being weak gylippus drew out his army by night and attacked it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.3,however the athenians who happened to be bivouacking outside took the alarm and came out to meet him upon seeing which he quickly led his men back again the athenians now built their wall higher and in future kept guard at this point themselves disposing their confederates along the remainder of the works at the stations assigned to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.4,nicias also determined to fortify plemmyrium a promontory over against the city which juts out and narrows the mouth of the great harbor he thought that the fortification of this place would make it easier to bring in supplies as they would be able to carry on their blockade from a less distance near to the port occupied by the syracusans instead of being obliged upon every movement of the enemy s navy to put out against them from the bottom of the great harbor besides this he now began to pay more attention to the war by sea seeing that the coming of gylippus had diminished their hopes by land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.5,accordingly he conveyed over his ships and some troops and built three forts in which he placed most of his baggage and moored there for the future the larger craft and menofwar
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.6,this was the first and chief occasion of the losses which the crews experienced the water which they used was scarce and had to be fetched from far and the sailors could not go out for firewood without being cut off by the syracusan horse who were masters of the country a third of the enemy s cavalry being stationed at the little town of olympieum to prevent plundering incursions on the part of the athenians at plemmyrium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.4.7,meanwhile nicias learned that the rest of the corinthian fleet was approaching and sent twenty ships to watch for them with orders to be on the lookout for them about locris and rhegium and the approach to sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.5.1,gylippus meanwhile went on with the wall across epipolae using the stones which the athenians had laid down for their own wall and at the same time constantly led out the syracusans and their allies and formed them in order of battle in front of the lines the athenians forming against him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.5.2,at last he thought that the moment was come and began the attack and a handtohand fight ensued between the lines where the syracusan cavalry could be of no use
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.5.3,and the syracusans and their allies were defeated and took up their dead under truce while the athenians erected a trophy after this gylippus called the soldiers together and said that the fault was not theirs but his he had kept their lines too much within the works and had thus deprived them of the services of their cavalry and darters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.5.4,he would now therefore lead them on a second time he begged them to remember that in material force they would be fully a match for their opponents while with respect to moral advantages it were intolerable if peloponnesians and dorians should not feel confident of overcoming ionians and islanders with the motley rabble that accompanied them and of driving them out of the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.6.1,after this he embraced the first opportunity that offered of again leading them against the enemy now nicias and the athenians were of opinion that even if the syracusans should not wish to offer battle it was necessary for them to prevent the building of the cross wall as it already almost overlapped the extreme point of their own and if it went any further it would from that moment make no difference whether they fought ever so many successful actions or never fought at all they accordingly came out to meet the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.6.2,gylippus led out his heavy infantry further from the fortifications than on the former occasion and so joined battle posting his horse and darters upon the flank of the athenians in the open space where the works of the two walls terminated
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.6.3,during the engagement the cavalry attacked and routed the left wing of the athenians which was opposed to them and the rest of the athenian army was in consequence defeated by the syracusans and driven headlong within their lines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.6.4,the night following the syracusans carried their wall up to the athenian works and passed them thus putting it out of their power any longer to stop them and depriving them even if victorious in the field of all chance of investing the city for the future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.7.1,after this the remaining twelve vessels of the corinthians ambraciots and leucadians sailed into the harbor under the command of erasinides a corinthian having eluded the athenian ships on guard and helped the syracusans in completing the remainder of the cross wall
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.7.2,meanwhile gylippus went into the rest of sicily to raise land and naval forces and also to bring over any of the cities that either were lukewarm in the cause or had hitherto kept out of the war altogether
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.7.3,syracusan and corinthian envoys were also despatched to lacedaemon and corinth to get a fresh force sent over in any way that might offer either in merchant vessels or transports or in any other manner likely to prove successful as the athenians too were sending for reinforcements
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.7.4,while the syracusans proceeded to man a fleet and to exercise meaning to try their fortune in this way also and generally became exceedingly confident
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.8.1,nicias perceiving this and seeing the strength of the enemy and his own difficulties daily increasing himself also sent to athens he had before sent frequent reports of events as they occurred and felt it especially incumbent upon him to do so now as he thought that they were in a critical position and that unless speedily recalled or strongly reinforced from home they had no hope of safety
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.8.2,he feared however that the messengers either through inability to speak or through failure of memory or from a wish to please the multitude might not report the truth and so though it best to write a letter to insure that the athenians should know his own opinion without its being lost in transmission and be able to decide upon the real facts of the case
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.8.3,his emissaries accordingly departed with the letter and the requisite verbal instructions and he attended to the affairs of the army making it his aim now to keep on the defensive and to avoid any unnecessary danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.9.1,at the close of the same summer the athenian general euetion marched in concert with perdiccas with a large body of thracians against amphipolis and failing to take it brought some galleys round into the strymon and blockaded the town from the river having his base at himeraeum summer was now over
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.10.1,the winter ensuing the persons sent by nicias reaching athens gave the verbal messages which had been entrusted to them and answered any questions that were asked them and delivered the letter the clerk of the city now came forward and read out to the athenians the letter which was as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.11.1,our past operations athenians have been made known to you by many other letters it is now time for you to become equally familiar with our present condition and to take your measures accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.11.2,we had defeated in most of our engagements with them the syracusans against whom we were sent and we had built the works which we now occupy when gylippus arrived from lacedaemon with an army obtained from peloponnese and from some of the cities in sicily in our first battle with him we were victorious in the battle on the following day we were overpowered by a multitude of cavalry and darters and compelled to retire within our lines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.11.3,we have now therefore been forced by the numbers of those opposed to us to discontinue the work of circumvallation and to remain inactive being unable to make use even of all the force we have since a large portion of our heavy infantry is absorbed in the defence of our lines meanwhile the enemy have carried a single wall past our lines thus making it impossible for us to invest them in future until this cross wall be attacked by a strong force and captured
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.11.4,so that the besieger in name has become at least from the land side the besieged in reality as we are prevented by their cavalry from even going for any distance into the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.12.1,besides this an embassy has been despatched to peloponnese to procure reinforcements and gylippus has gone to the cities in sicily partly in the hope of inducing those that are at present neutral to join him in the war partly of bringing from his allies additional contingents for the land forces and material for the navy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.12.2,for i understand that they contemplate a combined attack upon our lines with their land forces and with their fleet by sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.12.3,you must none of you be surprised that i say by sea also they have discovered that the length of the time we have now been in commission has rotted our ships and wasted our crews and that with the entireness of our crews and the soundness of our ships the pristine efficiency of our navy has departed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.12.4,for it is impossible for us to haul our ships ashore and careen them because the enemy s vessels being as many or more than our own we are constantly anticipating an attack
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.12.5,indeed they may be seen exercising and it lies with them to take the initiative and not having to maintain a blockade they have greater facilities for drying their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.13.1,this we should scarcely be able to do even if we had plenty of ships to spare and were freed from our present necessity of exhausting all our strength upon the blockade for it is already difficult to carry in supplies past syracuse and were we to relax our vigilance in the slightest degree it would become impossible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.13.2,the losses which our crews have suffered and still continue to suffer arise from the following causes expeditions for fuel and for forage and the distance from which water has to be fetched cause our sailors to be cut off by the syracusan cavalry the loss of our previous superiority emboldens our slaves to desert our foreign seamen are impressed by the unexpected appearance of a navy against us and the strength of the enemy s resistance such of them as were pressed into the service take the first opportunity of departing to their respective cities such as were originally seduced by the temptation of high pay and expected little fighting and large gains leave us either by desertion to the enemy or by availing themselves of one or other of the various facilities of escape which the magnitude of sicily affords them some even engage in trade themselves and prevail upon the captains to take hyccaric slaves on board in their place thus they have ruined the efficiency of our navy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.14.1,now i need not remind you that the time during which a crew is in its prime is short and that the number of sailors who can start a ship on her way and keep the rowing in time is small
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.14.2,but by far my greatest trouble is that holding the post which i do i am prevented by the natural indocility of the athenian seaman from putting a stop to these evils and that meanwhile we have no source from which to recruit our crews which the enemy can do from many quarters but are compelled to depend both for supplying the crews in service and for making good our losses upon the men whom we brought with us for our present confederates naxos and catana are incapable of supplying us
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.14.3,there is only one thing more wanting to our opponents i mean the defection of our italian markets if they were to see you neglect to relieve us from our present condition and were to go over to the enemy famine would compel us to evacuate and syracuse would finish the war without a blow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.14.4,i might it is true have written to you something different and more agreeable than this but nothing certainly more useful if it is desirable for you to know the real state of things here before taking your measures besides i know that it is your nature to love to be told the best side of things and then to blame the teller if the expectations which he has raised in your minds are not answered by the result and i therefore thought it safest to declare to you the truth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.15.1,now you are not to think that either your generals or your soldiers have ceased to be a match for the forces originally opposed to them but you are to reflect that a general sicilian coalition is being formed against us that a fresh army is expected from peloponnese while the force we have here is unable to cope even with our present antagonists and you must promptly decide either to recall us or to send out to us another fleet and army as numerous again with a large sum of money and some one to succeed me as a disease in the kidneys unfits me for retaining my post
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.15.2,i have i think some claim on your indulgence as while i was in my prime i did you much good service in my commands but whatever you mean to do do it at the commencement of spring and without delay as the enemy will obtain his sicilian reinforcements shortly those from peloponnese after a longer interval and unless you attend to the matter the former will be here before you while the latter will elude you as they have done before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.16.1,such were the contents of nicias letter when the athenians had heard it they refused to accept his resignation but chose him two colleagues naming menander and euthydemus two of the officers at the seat of war to fill their places until their arrival that nicias might not be left alone in his sickness to bear the whole weight of affairs they also voted to send out another army and navy drawn partly from the athenians on the musterroll partly from the allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.16.2,the colleagues chosen for nicias were demosthenes son of alcisthenes and eurymedon son of thucles eurymedon was sent off at once about the time of the winter solstice with ten ships a hundred and twenty talents of silver and instructions to tell the army that reinforcements would arrive and that care would be taken of them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.17.1,but demosthenes stayed behind to organize the expedition meaning to start as soon as it was spring and sent for troops to the allies and meanwhile got together money ships and heavy infantry at home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.17.2,the athenians also sent twenty vessels round peloponnese to prevent any one crossing over to sicily from corinth or peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.17.3,for the corinthians filled with confidence by the favorable alteration in sicilian affairs which had been reported by the envoys upon their arrival and convinced that the fleet which they had before sent out had not been without its use were now preparing to despatch a force of heavy infantry in merchant vessels to sicily while the lacedaemonians did the like for the rest of peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.17.4,the corinthians also named a fleet of twentyfive vessels intending to try the result of a battle with the squadron on guard at naupactus and meanwhile to make it less easy for the athenians there to hinder the departure of their merchantmen by obliging them to keep an eye upon the galleys thus arrayed against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.18.1,in the meantime the lacedaemonians prepared for their invasion of attica in accordance with their own previous resolve and at the instigation of the syracusans and corinthians who wished for an invasion to arrest the reinforcements which they heard that athens was about to send to sicily alcibiades also urgently advised the fortification of decelea and a vigorous prosecution of the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.18.2,but the lacedaemonians derived most encouragement from the belief that athens with two wars on her hands against themselves and against the siceliots would be more easy to subdue and from the conviction that she had been the first to infringe the truce in the former war they considered the offence had been more on their own side both on account of the entrance of the thebans into plataea in time of peace and also of their own refusal to listen to the athenian offer of arbitration in spite of the clause in the former treaty that where arbitration should be offered there should be no appeal to arms for this reason they thought that they deserved their misfortunes and took to heart seriously the disaster at pylos and whatever else had befallen them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.18.3,but when besides the ravages from pylos which went on without any intermission the thirty athenian ships came out from argos and wasted part of epidaurus prasiae and other places when upon every dispute that arose as to the interpretation of any doubtful point in the treaty their own offers of arbitration were always rejected by the athenians the lacedaemonians at length decided that athens had now committed the very same offence as they had before done and had become the guilty party and they began to be full of ardor for the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.18.4,they spent this winter in sending round to their allies for iron and in getting ready the other implements for building their fort and meanwhile began raising at home and also by forced requisitions in the rest of peloponnese a force to be sent out in the merchantmen to their allies in sicily winter thus ended and with it the eighteenth year of this war of which thucydides is the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.19.1,in the first days of the spring following at an earlier period than usual the lacedaemonians and their allies invaded attica under the command of agis son of archidamus king of the lacedaemonians they began by devastating the parts bordering upon the plain and next proceeded to fortify decelea dividing the work among the different cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.19.2,decelea is about thirteen or fourteen miles from the city of athens and the same distance or not much further from boeotia and the fort was meant to annoy the plain and the richest parts of the country being in sight of athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.19.3,while the peloponnesians and their allies in attica were engaged in the work of fortification their countrymen at home sent off at about the same time the heavy infantry in the merchant vessels to sicily the lacedaemonians furnishing a picked force of helots and neodamodes or freedmen six hundred heavy infantry in all under the command of eccritus a spartan and the boeotians three hundred heavy infantry commanded by two thebans xenon and nicon and by hegesander a thespian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.19.4,these were among the first to put out into the open sea starting from taenarus in laconia not long after their departure the corinthians sent off a force of five hundred heavy infantry consisting partly of men from corinth itself and partly of arcadian mercenaries placed under the command of alexarchus a corinthian the sicyonians also sent off two hundred heavy infantry at the same time as the corinthians under the command of sargeus a sicyonian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.19.5,meantime the fiveandtwenty vessels manned by corinth during the winter lay confronting the twenty athenian ships at naupactus until the heavy infantry in the merchantmen were fairly on their way from peloponnese thus fulfilling the object for which they had been manned originally which was to divert the attention of the athenians from the merchantmen to the galleys
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.20.1,during this time the athenians were not idle simultaneously with the fortification of decelea at the very beginning of spring they sent thirty ships round peloponnese under charicles son of apollodorus with instructions to call at argos and demand a force of their heavy infantry for the fleet agreeably to the alliance at the same time they despatched demosthenes to sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.20.2,as they had intended with sixty athenian and five chian vessels twelve hundred athenian heavy infantry from the musterroll and as many of the islanders as could be raised in the different quarters drawing upon the other subject allies for whatever they could supply that would be of use for the war demosthenes was instructed first to sail round with charicles and to operate with him upon the coasts of laconia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.20.3,and accordingly sailed to aegina and there waited for the remainder of his armament and for charicles to fetch the argive troops
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.21.1,in sicily about the same time in this spring gylippus came to syracuse with as many troops as he could bring from the cities which he had persuaded to join
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.21.2,calling the syracusans together he told them that they must man as many ships as possible and try their hand at a seafight by which he hoped to achieve an advantage in the war not unworthy of the risk
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.21.3,with him hermocrates actively joined in trying to encourage his countrymen to attack the athenians at sea saying that the latter had not inherited their naval prowess nor would they retain it for ever they had been landsmen even to a greater degree than the syracusans and had only become a maritime power when obliged by the mede besides to daring spirits like the athenians a daring adversary would seem the most formidable and the athenian plan of paralyzing by the boldness of their attack a neighbor often not their inferior in strength could now be used against them with as good effect by the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.21.4,he was convinced also that the unlookedfor spectacle of syracusans daring to face the athenian navy would cause a terror to the enemy the advantages of which would far outweigh any loss that athenian science might inflict upon their inexperience he accordingly urged them to throw aside their fears and to try their fortune at sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.21.5,and the syracusans under the influence of gylippus and hermocrates and perhaps some others made up their minds for the seafight and began to man their vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.22.1,when the fleet was ready gylippus led out the whole army by night his plan being to assault in person the forts of plemmyrium by land while thirtyfive syracusan galleys sailed according to appointment against the enemy from the great harbor and the fortyfive remaining came round from the lesser harbor where they had their arsenal in order to effect a junction with those inside and simultaneously to attack plemmyrium and thus to distract the athenians by assaulting them on two sides at once
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.22.2,the athenians quickly manned sixty ships and with twentyfive of these engaged the thirtyfive of the syracusans in the great harbor sending the rest to meet those sailing round from the arsenal and an action now ensued directly in front of the mouth of the great harbor maintained with equal tenacity on both sides the one wishing to force the passage the other to prevent them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.23.1,in the meantime while the athenians in plemmyrium were down at the sea attending to the engagement gylippus made a sudden attack on the forts in the early morning and took the largest first and afterwards the two smaller whose garrisons did not wait for him seeing the largest so easily taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.23.2,at the fall of the first fort the men from it who succeeded in taking refuge in their boats and merchantmen found great difficulty in reaching the camp as the syracusans were having the best of it in the engagement in the great harbor and sent a fast sailing galley to pursue them but when the two others fell the syracusans were now being defeated and the fugitives from these sailed along shore with more ease
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.23.3,the syracusan ships fighting off the mouth of the harbor forced their way through the athenian vessels and sailing in without any order fell foul of one another and transferred the victory to the athenians who not only routed the squadron in question but also that by which they were at first being defeated in the harbor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.23.4,sinking eleven of the syracusan vessels and killing most of the men except the crews of three ships whom they made prisoners their own loss was confined to three vessels and after hauling ashore the syracusan wrecks and setting up a trophy upon the islet in front of plemmyrium they retired to their own camp
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.24.1,unsuccessful at sea the syracusans had nevertheless the forts in plemmyrium for which they set up three trophies one of the two last taken they razed but put in order and garrisoned the two others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.24.2,in the capture of the forts a great many men were killed and made prisoners and a great quantity of property was taken in all as the athenians had used them as a magazine there was a large stock of goods and corn of the merchants inside and also a large stock belonging to the captains the masts and other furniture of forty galleys being taken besides three galleys which had been drawn up on shore
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.24.3,indeed the first and chiefest cause of the ruin of the athenian army was the capture of plemmyrium even the entrance of the harbor being now no longer safe for carrying in provisions as the syracusan vessels were stationed there to prevent it and nothing could be brought in without fighting besides the general impression of dismay and discouragement produced upon the army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.1,after this the syracusans sent out twelve ships under the command of agatharchus a syracusan one of these went to peloponnese with ambassadors to describe the hopeful state of their affairs and to incite the peloponnesians to prosecute the war there even more actively than they were now doing while the eleven others sailed to italy hearing that vessels laden with stores were on their way to the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.2,after falling in with and destroying most of the vessels in question and burning in the caulonian territory a quantity of timber for shipbuilding which had been got ready for the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.3,the syracusan squadron went to locri and one of the merchantmen from peloponnese coming in while they were at anchor there carrying thespian heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.4,took these on board and sailed along shore towards home the athenians were on the lookout for them with twenty ships at megara but were only able to take one vessel with its crew the rest getting clear off to syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.5,there was also some skirmishing in the harbor about the piles which the syracusans had driven in the sea in front of the old docks to allow their ships to lie at anchor inside without being hurt by the athenians sailing up and running them down
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.6,the athenians brought up to them a ship of ten thousand talents burden furnished with wooden turrets and screens and fastened ropes round the piles from their boats wrenched them up and broke them or dived down and sawed them in two meanwhile the syracusans plied them with missiles from the docks to which they replied from their large vessel until at last most of the piles were removed by the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.7,but the most awkward part of the stockade was the part out of sight some of the piles which had been driven in did not appear above water so that it was dangerous to sail up for fear of running the ships upon them just as upon a reef through not seeing them however divers went down and sawed off even these for reward although the syracusans drove in others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.8,indeed there was no end to the contrivances to which they resorted against each other as might be expected between two hostile armies confronting each other at such a short distance and skirmishes and all kinds of other attempts were of constant occurrence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.25.9,meanwhile the syracusans sent embassies to the cities composed of corinthians ambraciots and lacedaemonians to tell them of the capture of plemmyrium and that their defeat in the seafight was due less to the strength of the enemy than to their own disorder and generally to let them know that they were full of hope and to desire them to come to their help with ships and troops as the athenians were expected with a fresh army and if the one already there could be destroyed before the other arrived the war would be at an end
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.26.1,while the contending parties in sicily were thus engaged demosthenes having now got together the armament with which he was to go to the island put out from aegina and making sail for peloponnese joined charicles and the thirty ships of the athenians taking on board the heavy infantry from argos they sailed to laconia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.26.2,and after first plundering part of epidarus limera landed on the coast of laconia opposite cythera where the temple of apollo stands and laying waste part of the country fortified a sort of isthmus to which the helots of the lacedaemonians might desert and from whence plundering incursions might be made as from pylos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.26.3,demosthenes helped to occupy this place and then immediately sailed on to corcyra to take up some of the allies in that island and so to proceed without delay to sicily while charicles waited until he had completed the fortification of the place and leaving a garrison there returned home subsequently with his thirty ships and the argives also
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.27.1,this same summer arrived at athens thirteen hundred targeteers thracian swordsmen of the tribe of the dii who were to have sailed to sicily with demosthenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.27.2,since they had come too late the athenians determined to send them back to thrace whence they had come to keep them for the decelean war appearing too expensive as the pay of each man was a drachma a day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.27.3,indeed since decelea had been first fortified by the whole peloponnesian army during this summer and then occupied for the annoyance of the country by the garrisons from the cities relieving each other at stated intervals it had been doing great mischief to the athenians in fact this occupation by the destruction of property and loss of men which resulted from it was one of the principal causes of their ruin
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.27.4,previously the invasions were short and did not prevent their enjoying their land during the rest of the time the enemy was now permanently fixed in attica at one time it was an attack in force at another it was the regular garrison overrunning the country and making forays for its subsistence and the lacedaemonian king agis was in the field and diligently prosecuting the war great mischief was therefore done to the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.27.5,they were deprived of their whole country more than twenty thousand slaves had deserted a great part of them artisans and all their sheep and beasts of burden were lost and as the cavalry rode out daily upon excursions to decelea and to guard the country their horses were either lamed by being constantly worked upon rocky ground or wounded by the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.28.1,besides the transport of provisions from euboea which had before been carried on so much more quickly over land by decelea from oropus was now effected at great cost by sea round sunium everything the city required had to be imported from abroad and instead of a city it became a fortress
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.28.2,summer and winter the athenians were worn out by having to keep guard on the fortifications during the day by turns by night all together the cavalry excepted at the different military posts or upon the wall
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.28.3,but what most oppressed them was that they had two wars at once and had thus reached a pitch of frenzy which no one would have believed possible if he had heard of it before it had come to pass for could any one have imagined that even when besieged by the peloponnesians entrenched in attica they would still instead of withdrawing from sicily stay on there besieging in like manner syracuse a town taken as a town in no way inferior to athens or would so thoroughly upset the hellenic estimate of their strength and audacity as to give the spectacle of a people which at the beginning of the war some thought might hold out one year some two none more than three if the peloponnesians invaded their country now seventeen years after the first invasion after having already suffered from all the evils of war going to sicily and undertaking a new war nothing inferior to that which they already had with the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.28.4,these causes the great losses from decelea and the other heavy charges that fell upon them produced their financial embarrassment and it was at this time that they imposed upon their subjects instead of the tribute the tax of a twentieth upon all imports and exports by sea which they thought would bring them in more money their expenditure being now not the same as at first but having grown with the war while their revenues decayed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.29.1,accordingly not wishing to incur expense in their present want of money they sent back at once the thracians who came too late for demosthenes under the conduct of diitrephes who was instructed as they were to pass through the euripus to make use of them if possible in the voyage along shore to injure the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.29.2,diitrephes first landed them at tanagra and hastily snatched some booty he then sailed across the eurious in the evening from chalcis in euboea and disembarking in boeotia led them against mycalessus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.29.3,the night he passed unobserved near the temple of hermes not quite two miles from mycalessus and at daybreak assaulted and took the town which is not a large one the inhabitants being off their guard and not expecting that any one would ever come up so far from the sea to molest them the wall too being weak and in some places having tumbled down while in others it had not been built to any height and the gates also being left open through their feeling of security
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.29.4,the thracians bursting into mycalessus sacked the houses and temples and butchered the inhabitants sparing neither youth nor age but killing all they fell in with one after the other children and women and even beasts of burden and whatever other living creatures they saw the thracian race like the bloodiest of the barbarians being ever most so when it has nothing to fear
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.29.5,everywhere confusion reigned and death in all its shapes and in particular they attacked a boys school the largest that there was in the place into which the children had just gone and massacred them all in short the disaster falling upon the whole town was unsurpassed in magnitude and unapproached by any in suddenness and in horror
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.30.1,meanwhile the thebans heard of it and marched to the rescue and overtaking the thracians before they had gone far recovered the plunder and drove them in panic to the euripus and the sea where the vessels which brought them were lying
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.30.2,the greatest slaughter took place while they were embarking as they did not know how to swim and those in the vessels on seeing what was going on on shore moored them out of bowshot in the rest of the retreat the thracians made a very respectable defence against the theban horse by which they were first attacked dashing out and closing their ranks according to the tactics of their country and lost only a few men in that part of the affair a good number who were after plunder were actually caught in the town and put to death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.30.3,altogether the thracians had two hundred and fifty killed out of thirteen hundred the thebans and the rest who came to the rescue about twenty troopers and heavy infantry with scirphondas one of the boetarchs the mycalessians lost a large proportion of their population
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.31.1,while mycalessus thus experienced a calamity for its extent as lamentable as any that happened in the war demosthenes whom we left sailing to corcyra after the building of the fort in laconia found a merchantman lying at rhea in elis in which the corinthian heavy infantry were to cross to sicily the ship he destroyed but the men escaped and subsequently got another in which they pursued their voyage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.31.2,after this arriving at zacynthus and cephallenia he took a body of heavy infantry on board and sending for some of the messenians from naupactus crossed over to the opposite coast of acarnania to alyzia and to anactorium which was held by the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.31.3,while he was in these parts he was met by eurymedon returning from sicily where he had been sent as has been mentioned during the winter with the money for the army who told him the news and also that he had heard while at sea that the syracusans had taken plemmyrium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.31.4,here also conon came to them the commander at naupactus with news that the twentyfive corinthian ships stationed opposite to him far from giving over the war were meditating an engagement and he therefore begged them to send him some ships as his own eighteen were not a match for the enemy s twentyfive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.31.5,demosthenes and eurymedon accordingly sent ten of their best sailors with conon to reinforce the squadron at naupactus and meanwhile prepared for the muster of their forces eurymedon who was now the colleague of demosthenes and had turned back in consequence of his appointment sailing to corcyra to tell them to man fifteen ships and to enlist heavy infantry while demosthenes raised slingers and darters from the parts about acarnania
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.32.1,meanwhile the envoys already mentioned who had gone from syracuse to the cities after the capture of plemmyrium had succeeded in their mission and were about to bring the army that they had collected when nicias got scent of it and sent to the centoripae and alicyaeans and other of the friendly sicels who held the passes not to let the enemy through but to combine to prevent their passing there being no other way by which they could even attempt it as the agrigentines would not give them a passage through their country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.32.2,agreeably to this request the sicels laid a triple ambuscade for the siceliots upon their march and attacking them suddenly while off their guard killed about eight hundred of them and all the envoys the corinthian only excepted by whom fifteen hundred who escaped were conducted to syracuse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.33.1,about the same time the camarinaeans also came to the assistance of syracuse with five hundred heavy infantry three hundred darters and as many archers while the geloans sent crews for five ships four hundred darters and two hundred horse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.33.2,indeed almost the whole of sicily except the agrigentines who were neutral now ceased merely to watch events as it had hitherto done and actively joined syracuse against the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.33.3,while the syracusans after the sicel disaster put off any immediate attack upon the athenians demosthenes and eurymedon whose forces from corcyra and the continent were now ready crossed the ionian gulf with all their armament to the iapygian promontory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.33.4,and starting from thence touched at the choerades isles lying off iapygia where they took on board a hundred and fifty iapygian darters of the messapian tribe and after renewing an old friendship with artas the chief who had furnished them with the darters arrived at metapontium in italy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.33.5,here they persuaded their allies the metapontines to send with them three hundred darters and two galleys and with this reinforcement coasted on to thurii where they found the party hostile to athens recently expelled by a revolution
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.33.6,and accordingly remained there to muster and review the whole army to see if any had been left behind and to prevail upon the thurians resolutely to join them in their expedition and in the circumstances in which they found themselves to conclude a defensive and offensive alliance with the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.1,about the same time the peloponnesians in the twentyfive ships stationed opposite to the squadron at naupactus to protect the passage of the transports to sicily had got ready for engaging and manning some additional vessels so as to be numerically little inferior to the athenians anchored off erineus in achaia in the rhypic country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.2,the place off which they lay being in the form of a crescent the land forces furnished by the corinthians and their allies on the spot came up and ranged themselves upon the projecting headlands on either side while the fleet under the command of polyanthes a corinthian held the intervening space and blocked up the entrance
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.3,the athenians under diphilus now sailed out against them with thirtythree ships from naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.4,and the corinthians at first not moving at length thought they saw their opportunity raised the signal and advanced and engaged the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.5,after an obstinate struggle the corinthians lost three ships and without sinking any altogether disabled seven of the enemy which were struck prow to prow and had their foreships stoven in by the corinthian vessels whose cheeks had been strengthened for this very purpose
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.6,after an action of this even character in which either party could claim the victory although the athenians became masters of the wrecks through the wind driving them out to sea the corinthians not putting out again to meet them the two combatants parted no pursuit took place and no prisoners were made on either side the corinthians and peloponnesians who were fighting near the shore escaping with ease and none of the athenian vessels having been sunk
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.7,the athenians now sailed back to naupactus and the corinthians immediately set up a trophy as victors because they had disabled a greater number of the enemy s ships moreover they held that they had not been worsted for the very same reason that their opponent held that he had not been victorious the corinthians considering that they were conquerors if not decidedly conquered and the athenians thinking themselves vanquished because not decidedly victorious
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.34.8,however when the peloponnesians sailed off and their land forces had dispersed the athenians also set up a trophy as victors in achaia about two miles and a quarter from erineus the corinthian station
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.35.1,this was the termination of the action at naupactus to return to demosthenes and eurymedon the thurians having now got ready to join in the expedition with seven hundred heavy infantry and three hundred darters the two generals ordered the ships to sail along the coast to the crotonian territory and meanwhile held a review of all the land forces upon the river sybaris and then led them through the thurian country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.35.2,arrived at the river hylias they here received a message from the crotonians saying that they would not allow the army to pass through their country upon which the athenians descended towards the shore and bivouacked near the sea and the mouth of the hylias where the fleet also met them and the next day embarked and sailed along the coast touching at all the cities except locri until they came to petra in the rhegian territory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.36.1,meanwhile the syracusans hearing of their approach resolved to make a second attempt with their fleet and their other forces on shore which they had been collecting for this very purpose in order to do something before their arrival
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.36.2,in addition to other improvements suggested by the former seafight which they now adopted in the equipment of their navy they cut down their prows to a smaller compass to make them more solid and made their cheeks stouter and from these let stays into the vessel s sides for a length of six cubits within and without in the same way as the corinthians had altered their prows before engaging the squadron at naupactus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.36.3,the syracusans thought that they would thus have an advantage over the athenian vessels which were not constructed with equal strength but were slight in the bows from their being more used to sail round and charge the enemy s side than to meet him prow to prow and that the battle being in the great harbor with a great many ships in not much room was also a fact in their favour charging prow to prow they would stave in the enemy s bows by striking with solid and stout beaks against hollow and weak ones
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.36.4,and secondly the athenians for want of room would be unable to use their favorite manoeuvre of breaking the line or of sailing round as the syracusans would do their best not to let them do the one and want of room would prevent their doing the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.36.5,this charging prow to prow which had hitherto been thought want of skill in a helmsman would be the syracusans chief manoeuvre as being that which they should find most useful since the athenians if repulsed would not be able to back water in any direction except towards the shore and that only for a little way and in the little space in front of their own camp the rest of the harbor would be commanded by the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.36.6,and the athenians if hard pressed by crowding together in a small space and all to the same point would run foul of one another and fall into disorder which was in fact the thing that did the athenians most harm in all the seafights they not having like the syracusans the whole harbor to retreat over as to their sailing round into the open sea this would be impossible with the syracusans in possession of the way out and in especially as plemmyrium would be hostile to them and the mouth of the harbor was not large
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.37.1,with these contrivances to suit their skill and ability and now more confident after the previous seafight the syracusans attacked by land and sea at once
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.37.2,the town force gylippus led out a little the first and brought them up to the wall of the athenians where it looked towards the city while the force from the olympieum that is to say the heavy infantry that were there with the horse and the light troops of the syracusans advanced against the wall from the opposite side the ships of the syracusans and allies sailing out immediately afterwards
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.37.3,the athenians at first fancied that they were to be attacked by land only and it was not without alarm that they saw the fleet suddenly approaching as well and while some were forming upon the walls and in front of them against the advancing enemy and some marching out in haste against the numbers of horse and darters coming from the olympieum and from outside others manned the ships or rushed down to the beach to oppose the enemy and when the ships were manned put out with seventyfive sail against about eighty of the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.38.1,after spending a great part of the day in advancing and retreating and skirmishing with each other without either being able to gain any advantage worth speaking of except that the syracusans sank one or two of the athenian vessels they parted the land force at the same time retiring from the lines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.38.2,the next day the syracusans remained quiet and gave no signs of what they were going to do but nicias seeing that the battle had been a drawn one and expecting that they would attack again compelled the captains to refit any of the ships that had suffered and moored merchant vessels before the stockade which they had driven into the sea in front of their ships
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.38.3,to serve instead of an enclosed harbor at about two hundred feet from each other in order that any ship that was hard pressed might be able to retreat in safety and sail out again at leisure these preparations occupied the athenians all day until nightfall
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.39.1,the next day the syracusans began operations at an earlier hour but with the same plan of attack by land and sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.39.2,a great part of the day the rivals spent as before confronting and skirmishing with each other until at last ariston son of pyrrhicus a corinthian the ablest helmsman in the syracusan service persuaded their naval commanders to send to the officials in the city and tell them to move the sale market as quickly as they could down to the sea and oblige every one to bring whatever eatables he had and sell them there thus enabling the commanders to land the crews and dine at once close to the ships and shortly afterwards the selfsame day to attack the athenians again when they were not expecting it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.40.1,in compliance with this advice a messenger was sent and the market got ready upon which the syracusans suddenly backed water and withdrew to the town and at once landed and took their dinner upon the spot
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.40.2,while the athenians supposing that they had returned to the town because they felt they were beaten disembarked at their leisure and set about getting their dinners and about their other occupations under the idea that they had done with fighting for that day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.40.3,suddenly the syracusans manned their ships and again sailed against them and the athenians in great confusion and most of them fasting got on board and with great difficulty put out to meet them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.40.4,for some time both parties remained on the defensive without engaging until the athenians at last resolved not to let themselves be worn out by waiting where they were but to attack without delay and giving a cheer went into action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.40.5,the syracusans received them and charging prow to prow as they had intended stove in a great part of the athenian foreships by the strength of their beaks the darters on the decks also did great damage to the athenians but still greater damage was done by the syracusans who went about in small boats ran in upon the oars of the athenian galleys and sailed against their sides and discharged from thence their darts upon the sailors
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.41.1,at last fighting hard in this fashion the syracusans gained the victory and the athenians turned and fled between the merchantmen to their own station
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.41.2,the syracusan ships pursued them as far as the merchantmen where they were stopped by the beams armed with dolphins suspended from those vessels over the passage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.41.3,two of the syracusan vessels went too near in the excitement of victory and were destroyed one of them being taken with its crew
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.41.4,after sinking seven of the athenian vessels and disabling many and taking most of the men prisoners and killing others the syracusans retired and set up trophies for both the engagements being now confident of having a decided superiority by sea and by no means despairing of equal success by land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.42.1,in the meantime while the syracusans were preparing for a second attack upon both elements demosthenes and eurymedon arrived with the succors from athens consisting of about seventythree ships including the foreigners nearly five thousand heavy infantry athenian and allied a large number of darters hellenic and barbarian and slingers and archers and everything else upon a corresponding scale
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.42.2,the syracusans and their allies were for the moment not a little dismayed at the idea that there was to be no term or ending to their dangers seeing in spite of the fortification of decelea a new army arrive nearly equal to the former and the power of athens proving so great in every quarter on the other hand the first athenian armament regained a certain confidence in the midst of its misfortunes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.42.3,demosthenes seeing how matters stood felt that he could not drag on and fare as nicias had done who by wintering in catana instead of at once attacking syracuse had allowed the terror of his first arrival to evaporate in contempt and had given time to gylippus to arrive with a force from peloponnese which the syracusans would never have sent for if he had attacked immediately for they fancied that they were a match for him by themselves and would not have discovered their inferiority until they were already invested and even if they then sent for succors they would no longer have been equally able to profit by their arrival recollecting this and well aware that it was now on the first day after his arrival that he like nicias was most formidable to the enemy demosthenes determined to lose no time in drawing the utmost profit from the consternation at the moment inspired by his army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.42.4,and seeing that the counter wall of the syracusans which hindered the athenians from investing them was a single one and that he who should become master of the way up to epipolae and afterwards of the camp there would find no difficulty in taking it as no one would even wait for his attack made all haste to attempt the enterprise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.42.5,this he took to be the shortest way of ending the war as he would either succeed and take syracuse or would lead back the armament instead of frittering away the lives of the athenians engaged in the expedition and the resources of the country at large
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.42.6,first therefore the athenians went out and laid waste the lands of the syracusans about the anapus and carried all before them as at first by land and by sea the syracusans not offering to oppose them upon either element unless it were with their cavalry and darters from the olympieum
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.1,next demosthenes resolved to attempt the counter wall first by means of engines as however the engines that he brought up were burnt by the enemy fighting from the wall and the rest of the forces repulsed after attacking at many different points he determined to delay no longer and having obtained the consent of nicias and his fellowcommanders proceeded to put in execution his plan of attacking epipolae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.2,as by day it seemed impossible to approach and get up without being observed he ordered provisions for five days took all the masons and carpenters and other things such as arrows and everything else that they could want for the work of fortification if successful and after the first watch set out with eurymedon and menander and the whole army for epipolae nicias being left behind in the lines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.3,having come up by the hill of euryelus where the former army had ascended at first unobserved by the enemy s guards they went up to the fort which the syracusans had there and took it and put to the sword part of the garrison
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.4,the greater number however escaped at once and gave the alarm to the camps of which there were three upon epipolae defended by outworks one of the syracusans one of the other siceliots and one of the allies and also to the six hundred syracusans forming the original garrison for this part of epipolae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.5,these at once advanced against the assailants and falling in with demosthenes and the athenians were routed by them after a sharp resistance the victors immediately pushing on eager to achieve the objects of the attack without giving time for their ardor to cool meanwhile others from the very beginning were taking the counter wall of the syracusans which was abandoned by its garrison and pulling down the battlements
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.6,the syracusans and the allies and gylippus with the troops under his command advanced to the rescue from the outworks but engaged in some consternation a night attack being a piece of audacity which they had never expected and were at first compelled to retreat
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.43.7,but while the athenians flushed with their victory now advanced with less order wishing to make their way as quickly as possible through the whole force of the enemy not yet engaged without relaxing their attack or giving them time to rally the boeotians made the first stand against them attacked them routed them and put them to flight
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.1,the athenians now fell into great disorder and perplexity so that it was not easy to get from one side or the other any detailed account of the affair by day certainly the combatants have a clearer notion though even then by no means of all that takes place no one knowing much of anything that does not go on in his own immediate neighborhood but in a night engagement and this was the only one that occurred between great armies during the war how could any one know anything for certain
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.2,although there was a bright moon they saw each other only as men do by moonlight that is to say they could distinguish the form of the body but could not tell for certain whether it was a friend or an enemy both had great numbers of heavy infantry moving about in a small space
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.3,some of the athenians were already defeated while others were coming up yet unconquered for their first attack a large part also of the rest of their forces either had only just got up or were still ascending so that they did not know which way to march owing to the rout that had taken place all in front was now in confusion and the noise made it difficult to distinguish anything
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.4,the victorious syracusans and allies were cheering each other on with loud cries by night the only possible means of communication and meanwhile receiving all who came against them while the athenians were seeking for one another taking all in front of them for enemies even although they might be some of their now flying friends and by constantly asking for the watchword which was their only means of recognition not only caused great confusion among themselves by asking all at once but also made it known to the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.5,whose own they did not so readily discover as the syracusans were victorious and not scattered and thus less easily mistaken the result was that if the athenians fell in with a party of the enemy that was weaker than they it escaped them through knowing their watchword while if they themselves failed to answer they were put to the sword
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.6,but what hurt them as much or indeed more than anything else was the singing of the paean from the perplexity which it caused by being nearly the same on either side the argives and corcyraeans and any other dorian peoples in the army struck terror into the athenians whenever they raised their paean no less than did the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.7,thus after being once thrown into disorder they ended by coming into collision with each other in many parts of the field friends with friends and citizens with citizens and not only terrified one another but even came to blows and could only be parted with difficulty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.44.8,in the pursuit many perished by throwing themselves down the cliffs the way down from epipolae being narrow and of those who got down safely into the plain although many especially those who belonged to the first armament escaped through their better acquaintance with the locality some of the newcomers lost their way and wandered over the country and were cut off in the morning by the syracusan cavalry and killed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.45.1,the next day the syracusans set up two trophies one upon epipolae where the ascent had been made and the other on the spot where the first check was given by the boeotians and the athenians took back their dead under truce
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.45.2,a great many of the athenians and allies were killed although still more arms were taken than could be accounted for by the number of the dead as some of those who were obliged to leap down from the cliffs without their shields escaped with their lives and did not perish like the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.46.1,after this the syracusans recovering their old confidence at such an unexpected stroke of good fortune despatched sicanus with fifteen ships to agrigentum where there was a revolution to induce if possible the city to join them while gylippus again went by land into the rest of sicily to bring up reinforcements being now in hope of taking the athenian lines by storm after the result of the affair on epipolae
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.47.1,in the meantime the athenian generals consulted upon the disaster which had happened and upon the general weakness of the army they saw themselves unsuccessful in their enterprises and the soldiers disgusted with their stay

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.47.3,accordingly demosthenes was of opinion that they ought not to stay any longer but agreeably to his original idea in risking the attempt upon epipolae now that this had failed he gave his vote for going away without further loss of time while the sea might yet be crossed and their late reinforcement might give them the superiority at all events on that element
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.47.4,he also said that it would be more profitable for the state to carry on the war against those who were building fortifications in attica than against the syracusans whom it was no longer easy to subdue besides which it was not right to squander large sums of money to no purpose by going on with the siege
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.48.1,this was the opinion of demosthenes nicias without denying the bad state of their affairs was unwilling to avow their weakness or to have it reported to the enemy that the athenians in full council were openly voting for retreat for in that case they would be much less likely to effect it when they wanted without discovery
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.48.2,moreover his own particular information still gave him reason to hope that the affairs of the enemy would soon be in a worse state than their own if the athenians persevered in the siege as they would wear out the syracusans by want of money especially with the more extensive command of the sea now given them by their present navy besides this there was a party in syracuse who wished to betray the city to the athenians and kept sending him messages and telling him not to raise the siege
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.48.3,accordingly knowing this and really waiting because he hesitated between the two courses and wished to see his way more clearly in his public speech on this occasion he refused to lead off the army saying he was sure the athenians would never approve of their returning without a vote of theirs those who would vote upon their conduct instead of judging the facts as eyewitnesses like themselves and not from what they might hear from hostile critics would simply be guided by the calumnies of the first clever speaker
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.48.4,while many indeed most of the soldiers on the spot who now so loudly proclaimed the danger of their position when they reached athens would proclaim just as loudly the opposite and would say that their generals had been bribed to betray them and return for himself therefore who knew the athenian temper sooner than perish under a dishonorable charge and by an unjust sentence at the hands of the athenians he would rather take his chance and die if die he must a soldier s death at the hand of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.48.5,besides after all the syracusans were in a worse case than themselves what with paying mercenaries spending upon fortified posts and now for a full year maintaining a large navy they were already at a loss and would soon be at a standstill they had already spent two thousand talents and incurred heavy debts besides and could not lose even ever so small a fraction of their present force through not paying it without ruin to their cause depending as they did more upon mercenaries than upon soldiers obliged to serve like their own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.48.6,he therefore said that they ought to stay and carry on the siege and not depart defeated in point of money in which they were much superior
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.49.1,nicias spoke positively because he had exact information of the financial distress at syracuse and also because of the strength of the athenian party there which kept sending him messages not to raise the siege besides which he had more confidence than before in his fleet and felt sure at least of its success
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.49.2,demosthenes however would not hear for a moment of continuing the siege but said that if they could not lead off the army without a decree from athens and if they were obliged to stay on they ought to remove to thapsus or catana where their land forces would have a wide extent of country to overrun and could live by plundering the enemy and would thus do them damage while the fleet would have the open sea to fight in that is to say instead of a narrow space which was all in the enemy s favour a wide searoom where their science would be of use and where they could retreat or advance without being confined or circumscribed either when they put out or put in
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.49.3,in any case he was altogether opposed to their staying on where they were and insisted on removing at once as quickly and with as little delay as possible and in this judgment eurymedon agreed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.49.4,nicias however still objecting a certain diffidence and hesitation came over them with a suspicion that nicias might have some further information to make him so positive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.50.1,while the athenians lingered on in this way without moving from where they were gylippus and sicanus now arrived at syracuse sicanus had failed to gain agrigentum the party friendly to the syracusans having been driven out while he was still at gela but gylippus was accompanied not only by a large number of troops raised in sicily but by the heavy infantry sent off in the spring from peloponnese in the merchantmen who had arrived at selinus from libya
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.50.2,they had been carried to libya by a storm and having obtained two galleys and pilots from the cyrenians on their voyage along shore had taken sides with the euesperitae and had defeated the libyans who were besieging them and from thence coasting on to neapolis a carthaginian mart and the nearest point to sicily from which it is only two days and a night s voyage there crossed over and came to selinus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.50.3,immediately upon their arrival the syracusans prepared to attack the athenians again by land and sea at once the athenian generals seeing a fresh army come to the aid of the enemy and that their own circumstances far from improving were becoming daily worse and above all distressed by the sickness of the soldiers now began to repent of not having removed before and nicias no longer offering the same opposition except by urging that there should be no open voting they gave orders as secretly as possible for all to be prepared to sail out from the camp at a given signal
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.50.4,all was at last ready and they were on the point of sailing away when an eclipse of the moon which was then at the full took place most of the athenians deeply impressed by this occurrence now urged the generals to wait and nicias who was somewhat overaddicted to divination and practices of that kind refused from that moment even to take the question of departure into consideration until they had waited the thrice nine days prescribed by the soothsayers the besiegers were thus condemned to stay in the country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.51.1,and the syracusans getting wind of what had happened became more eager than ever to press the athenians who had now themselves acknowledged that they were no longer their superiors either by sea or by land as otherwise they would never have planned to sail away besides which the syracusans did not wish them to settle in any other part of sicily where they would be more difficult to deal with but desired to force them to fight at sea as quickly as possible in a position favorable to themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.51.2,accordingly they manned their ships and practised for as many days as they thought sufficient when the moment arrived they assaulted on the first day the athenian lines and upon a small force of heavy infantry and horse sallying out against them by certain gates cut off some of the former and routed and pursued them to the lines where as the entrance was narrow the athenians lost seventy horses and some few of the heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.52.1,drawing off their troops for this day on the next the syracusans went out with a fleet of seventysix sail and at the same time advanced with their land forces against the lines the athenians put out to meet them with eightysix ships came to close quarters and engaged the syracusans and their allies first defeated the athenian center
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.52.2,and then caught eurymedon the commander of the right wing who was sailing out from the line more towards the land in order to surround the enemy in the hollow and recess of the harbor and killed him and destroyed the ships accompanying him after which they now chased the whole athenian fleet before them and drove them ashore
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.53.1,gylippus seeing the enemy s fleet defeated and carried ashore beyond their stockades and camp ran down to the breakwater with some of his troops in order to cut off the men as they landed and make it easier for the syracusans to tow off the vessels by the shore being friendly ground
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.53.2,the tyrrhenians who guarded this point for the athenians seeing them come on in disorder advanced out against them and attacked and routed their van hurling it into the marsh of lysimeleia
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.53.3,afterwards the syracusan and allied troops arrived in greater numbers and the athenians fearing for their ships came up also to the rescue and engaged them and defeated and pursued them to some distance and killed a few of their heavy infantry they succeeded in rescuing most of their ships and brought them down by their camp eighteen however were taken by the syracusans and their allies and all the men killed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.53.4,the rest the enemy tried to burn by means of an old merchantman which they filled with faggots and pinewood set on fire and let drift down the wind which blew full on the athenians the athenians however alarmed for their ships contrived means for stopping it and putting it out and checking the flames and the nearer approach of the merchantman thus escaped the danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.54.1,after this the syracusans set up a trophy for the seafight and for the heavy infantry whom they had cut off up at the lines where they took the horses and the athenians for the rout of the foot driven by the tyrrhenians into the marsh and for their own victory with the rest of the army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.55.1,the syracusans had now gained a decisive victory at sea where until now they had feared the reinforcement brought by demosthenes and deep in consequence was the despondency of the athenians and great their disappointment and greater still their regret for having come on the expedition
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.55.2,these were the only cities that they had yet encountered similar to their own in character under democracies like themselves which had ships and horses and were of considerable magnitude they had been unable to divide and bring them over by holding out the prospect of changes in their governments or to crush them by their great superiority in force but had failed in most of their attempts and being already in perplexity had now been defeated at sea where defeat could never have been expected and were thus plunged deeper in embarrassment than ever
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.56.1,meanwhile the syracusans immediately began to sail freely along the harbor and determined to close up its mouth so that the athenians might not be able to steal out in future even if they wished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.56.2,indeed the syracusans no longer thought only of saving themselves but also how to hinder the escape of the enemy thinking and thinking rightly that they were now much the strongest and that to conquer the athenians and their allies by land and sea would win them great glory in hellas the rest of the hellenes would thus immediately be either freed or released from apprehension as the remaining forces of athens would be henceforth unable to sustain the war that would be waged against her while they the syracusans would be regarded as the authors of this deliverance and would be held in high admiration not only with all men now living but also with posterity
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.56.3,nor were these the only considerations that gave dignity to the struggle they would thus conquer not only the athenians but also their numerous allies and conquer not alone but with their companionsinarms commanding side by side with the corinthians and lacedaemonians having offered their city to stand in the van of danger and having been in a great measure the pioneers of naval success
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.56.4,indeed there were never so many peoples assembled before a single city if we except the grand total gathered together in this war under athens and lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.1,the following were the states on either side who came to syracuse to fight for or against sicily to help to conquer or defend the island right or community of blood was not the bond of union between them so much as interest or compulsion as the case might be
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.2,the athenians themselves being ionians went against the dorians of syracuse of their own free will and the peoples still speaking attic and using the athenian laws the lemnians imbrians and aeginetans that is to say the then occupants of aegina being their colonists went with them to these must be also added the hestiaeans dwelling at hestiaea in euboea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.3,of the rest some joined in the expedition as subjects of the athenians others as independent allies others as mercenaries
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.4,to the number of the subjects paying tribute belonged the eretrians chalcidians styrians and carystians from euboea the ceans andrians and tenians from the islands and the milesians samians and chians from ionia the chians however joined as independent allies paying no tribute but furnishing ships most of these were ionians and descended from the athenians except the carystians who are dryopes and although subjects and obliged to serve were still ionians fighting against dorians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.5,besides these there were men of aeolic race the methymnians subjects who provided ships not tribute and the tenedians and aenians who paid tribute these aeolians fought against their aeolian founders the boeotians in the syracusan army because they were obliged while the plataeans the only native boeotians opposed to boeotians did so upon a just quarrel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.6,of the rhodians and cytherians both dorians the latter lacedaemonian colonists fought in the athenian ranks against their lacedaemonian countrymen with gylippus while the rhodians argives by race were compelled to bear arms against the dorian syracusans and their own colonists the geloans serving with the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.7,of the islanders round peloponnese the cephallenians and zacynthians accompanied the athenians as independent allies although their insular position really left them little choice in the matter owing to the maritime supremacy of athens while the corcyraeans who were not only dorians but corinthians were openly serving against corinthians and syracusans although colonists of the former and of the same race as the latter under color of compulsion but really out of free will through hatred of corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.8,the messenians as they are now called in naupactus and from pylos then held by the athenians were taken with them to the war there were also a few megarian exiles whose fate it was to be now fighting against the megarian selinuntines
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.9,the engagement of the rest was more of a voluntary nature it was less the league than hatred of the lacedaemonians and the immediate private advantage of each individual that persuaded the dorian argives to join the ionian athenians in a war against dorians while the mantineans and other arcadian mercenaries accustomed to go against the enemy pointed out to them at the moment were led by interest to regard the arcadians serving with the corinthians as just as much their enemies as any others the cretans and aetolians also served for hire and the cretans who had joined the rhodians in founding gela thus came to consent to fight for pay against instead of for their colonists
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.10,there were also some acarnanians paid to serve although they came chiefly for love of demosthenes and out of goodwill to the athenians whose allies they were these all lived on the hellenic side of the ionian gulf
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.57.11,of the italiots there were the thurians and metapontines dragged into the quarrel by the stern necessities of a time of revolution of the siceliots the naxians and the catanians and of the barbarians the egestaeans who called in the athenians most of the sicels and outside sicily some tyrrhenian enemies of syracuse and iapygian mercenaries

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.58.4,in comparison however with these foreign auxiliaries the great siceliot cities furnished more in every department numbers of heavy infantry ships and horses and an immense multitude besides having been brought together while in comparison again one may say with all the rest put together more was provided by the syracusans themselves both from the greatness of the city and from the fact that they were in the greatest danger
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.59.1,such were the auxiliaries brought together on either side all of which had by this time joined neither party experiencing any subsequent accession
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.59.2,it was no wonder therefore if the syracusans and their allies thought that it would win them great glory if they could follow up their recent victory in the seafight by the capture of the whole athenian armada without letting it escape either by sea or by land
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.59.3,they began at once to close up the great harbor by means of boats merchant vessels and galleys moored broadside across its mouth which is nearly a mile wide and made all their other arrangements for the event of the athenians again venturing to fight at sea there was in fact nothing little either in their plans or their ideas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.60.1,the athenians seeing them closing up the harbor and informed of their further designs called a council of war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.60.2,the generals and colonels assembled and discussed the difficulties of the situation the point which pressed most being that they no longer had provisions for immediate use having sent on to catana to tell them not to send any in the belief that they were going away and that they would not have any in future unless they could command the sea they therefore determined to evacuate their upper lines to enclose with a crosswall and garrison a small space close to the ships only just sufficient to hold their stores and sick and manning all the ships seaworthy or not with every man that could be spared from the rest of their land forces to fight it out at sea and if victorious to go to catana if not to burn their vessels form in close order and retreat by land for the nearest friendly place they could reach hellenic or barbarian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.60.3,this was no sooner settled than carried into effect they descended gradually from the upper lines and manned all their vessels compelling all to go on board who were of age to be in any way of use
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.60.4,they thus succeeded in manning about one hundred and ten ships in all on board of which they embarked a number of archers and darters taken from the acarnanians and from the other foreigners making all other provisions allowed by the nature of their plan and by the necessities which imposed it

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.62.1,now whatever we thought would be of service against the crush of vessels in such a narrow harbor and against the force upon the decks of the enemy from which we suffered before has all been considered with the helmsmen and as far as our means allowed provided
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.62.2,a number of archers and darters will go on board and a multitude that we should not have employed in an action in the open sea where our science would be crippled by the weight of the vessels but in the present landfight that we are forced to make from shipboard all this will be useful
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.62.3,we have also discovered the changes in construction that we must make to meet theirs and against the thickness of their cheeks which did us the greatest mischief we have provided grapplingirons which will prevent an assailant backing water after charging if the soldiers on deck here do their duty
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.62.4,since we are absolutely compelled to fight a land battle from the fleet and it seems to be our interest neither to back water ourselves nor to let the enemy do so especially as the shore except so much of it as may be held by our troops is hostile ground
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.63.1,you must remember this and fight on as long as you can and must not let yourselves be driven ashore but once alongside must make up your minds not to part company until you have swept the heavy infantry from the enemy s deck
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.63.2,i say this more for the heavy infantry than for the seamen as it is more the business of the men on deck and our land forces are even now on the whole the strongest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.63.3,the sailors i advise and at the same time implore not to be too much daunted by their misfortunes now that we have our decks better armed and a greater number of vessels bear in mind how well worth preserving is the pleasure felt by those of you who through your knowledge of our language and imitation of our manners were always considered athenians even though not so in reality and as such were honored throughout hellas and had your full share of the advantages of our empire and more than your share in the respect of our subjects and in protection from ill treatment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.63.4,you therefore with whom alone we freely share our empire we now justly require not to betray that empire in its extremity and in scorn of corinthians whom you have often conquered and of siceliots none of whom so much as presumed to stand against us when our navy was in its prime we ask you to repel them and to show that even in sickness and disaster your skill is more than a match for the fortune and vigor of any other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.64.1,for the athenians among you i add once more this reflection you left behind you no more such ships in your docks as these no more heavy infantry in their flower if you do aught but conquer our enemies here will immediately sail thither and those that are left of us at athens will become unable to repel their home assailants reinforced by these new allies here you will fall at once into the hands of the syracusans i need not remind you of the intentions with which you attacked them and your countrymen at home will fall into those of the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.64.2,since the fate of both thus hangs upon this single battle now if ever stand firm and remember each and all that you who are now going on board are the army and navy of the athenians and all that is left of the state and the great name of athens in whose defence if any man has any advantage in skill or courage now is the time for him to show it and thus serve himself and save all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.65.1,after this address nicias at once gave orders to man the ships meanwhile gylippus and the syracusans could perceive by the preparations which they saw going on that the athenians meant to fight at sea they had also notice of the grapplingirons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.65.2,against which they specially provided by stretching hides over the prows and much of the upper part of their vessels in order that the irons when thrown might slip off without taking hold

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.66.1,syracusans and allies the glorious character of our past achievements and the no less glorious results at issue in the coming battle are we think understood by most of you or you would never have thrown yourselves with such ardor into the struggle and if there be any one not as fully aware of the facts as he ought to be we will declare them to him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.66.2,the athenians came to this country first to effect the conquest of sicily and after that if successful of peloponnese and the rest of hellas possessing already the greatest empire yet known of present or former times among the hellenes here for the first time they found in you men who faced their navy which made them masters everywhere you have already defeated them in the previous seafight and will in all likelihood defeat them again now
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.66.3,when men are once checked in what they consider their special excellence their whole opinion of themselves suffers more than if they had not at first believed in their superiority the unexpected shock to their pride causing them to give way more than their real strength warrants and this is probably now the case with the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.67.1,with us it is different the original estimate of ourselves which gave us courage in the days of our unskillfulness has been strengthened while the convictions superadded to it that we must be the best seamen of the time if we have conquered the best has given a double measure of hope to every man among us and for the most part where there is the greatest hope there is also the greatest ardor for action
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.67.2,the means to combat us which they have tried to find in copying our armament are familiar to our warfare and will be met by proper provisions while they will never be able to have a number of heavy infantry on their decks contrary to their custom and a number of darters born landsmen one may say acarnanians and others embarked afloat who will not know how to discharge their weapons when they have to keep still without hampering their vessels and falling all into confusion among themselves through fighting not according to their own tactics

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.67.4,indeed if you would know the plain truth as we are credibly informed the excess of their sufferings and the necessities of their present distress have made them desperate they have no confidence in their force but wish to try their fortune in the only way they can and either to force their passage and sail out or after this to retreat by land it being impossible for them to be worse off than they are
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.68.1,the fortune of our greatest enemies having thus betrayed itself and their disorder being what i have described let us engage in anger convinced that as between adversaries nothing is more legitimate than to claim to sate the whole wrath of one s soul in punishing the aggressor and nothing more sweet as the proverb has it than the vengeance upon an enemy which it will now be ours to take

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.68.3,none should therefore relent or think it gain if they go away without further danger to us this they will do just the same even if they get the victory while if we succeed as we may expect in chastising them and in handing down to all sicily her ancient freedom strengthened and confirmed we shall have achieved no mean triumph and the rarest dangers are those in which failure brings little loss and success the greatest advantage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.69.1,after the above address to the soldiers on their side the syracusan generals and gylippus now perceived that the athenians were manning their ships and immediately proceeded to man their own also
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.69.2,meanwhile nicias appalled by the position of affairs realizing the greatness and the nearness of the danger now that they were on the point of putting out from shore and thinking as men are apt to think in great crises that when all has been done they have still something left to do and when all has been said that they have not yet said enough again called on the captains one by one addressing each by his father s name and by his own and by that of his tribe and adjured them not to belie their own personal renown or to obscure the hereditary virtues for which their ancestors were illustrious he reminded them of their country the freest of the free and of the unfettered discretion allowed in it to all to live as they pleased and added other arguments such as men would use at such a crisis and which with little alteration are made to serve on all occasions alike appeals to wives children and national gods without caring whether they are thought commonplace but loudly invoking them in the belief that they will be of use in the consternation of the moment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.69.3,having thus admonished them not he felt as he would but as he could nicias withdrew and led the troops to the sea and ranged them in as long a line as he was able in order to aid as far as possible in sustaining the courage of the men afloat
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.69.4,while demosthenes menander and euthydemus who took the command on board put out from their own camp and sailed straight to the barrier across the mouth of the harbor and to the passage left open to try to force their way out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.1,the syracusans and their allies had already put out with about the same number of ships as before a part of which kept guard at the outlet and the remainder all round the rest of the harbor in order to attack the athenians on all sides at once while the land forces held themselves in readiness at the points at which the vessels might put into the shore the syracusan fleet was commanded by sicanus and agatharchus who had each a wing of the whole force with pythen and the corinthians in the center
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.2,when the rest of the athenians came up to the barrier with the first shock of their charge they overpowered the ships stationed there and tried to undo the fastenings after this as the syracusans and allies bore down upon them from all quarters the action spread from the barrier over the whole harbor and was more obstinately disputed than any of the preceding ones
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.3,on either side the rowers showed great zeal in bringing up their vessels at the boatswains orders and the helmsmen great skill in maneuvering and great emulation one with another while the ships once alongside the soldiers on board did their best not to let the service on deck be outdone by the others
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.4,in short every man strove to prove himself the first in his particular department and as many ships were engaged in a small compass for these were the largest fleets fighting in the narrowest space ever known being together little short of two hundred the regular attacks with the beak were few there being no opportunity of backing water or of breaking the line while the collisions caused by one ship chancing to run foul of another either in flying from or attacking a third were more frequent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.5,so long as a vessel was coming up to the charge the men on the decks rained darts and arrows and stones upon her but once alongside the heavy infantry tried to board each other s vessel fighting hand to hand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.6,in many quarters also it happened by reason of the narrow room that a vessel was charging an enemy on one side and being charged herself on another and that two or sometimes more ships had perforce got entangled round one obliging the helmsmen to attend to defence here offence there not to one thing at once but to many on all sides while the huge din caused by the number of ships crashing together not only spread terror but made the orders of the boatswains inaudible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.7,the boatswains on either side in the discharge of their duty and in the heat of the conflict shouted incessantly orders and appeals to their men the athenians they urged to force the passage out and now if ever to show their mettle and lay hold of a safe return to their country to the syracusans and their allies they cried that it would be glorious to prevent the escape of the enemy and conquering to exalt the countries that were theirs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.70.8,the generals moreover on either side if they saw in any part of the battle backing ashore without being forced to do so called out to the captain by name and asked him the athenians whether they were retreating because they thought the thrice hostile shore more their own than that sea which had cost them so much labour to win the syracusans whether they were flying from the flying athenians whom they well knew to be eager to escape in whatever way they could
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.1,meanwhile the two armies on shore while victory hung in the balance were a prey to the most agonizing and conflicting emotions the natives thirsting for more glory than they had already won while the invaders feared to find themselves in even worse plight than before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.2,the all of the athenians being set upon their fleet their fear for the event was like nothing they had ever felt while their view of the struggle was necessarily as checkered as the battle itself
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.3,close to the scene of action and not all looking at the same point at once some saw their friends victorious and took courage and fell to calling upon heaven not to deprive them of salvation while others who had their eyes turned upon the losers wailed and cried aloud and although spectators were more overcome than the actual combatants others again were gazing at some spot where the battle was evenly disputed as the strife was protracted without decision their swaying bodies reflected the agitation of their minds and they suffered the worst agony of all ever just within reach of safety or just on the point of destruction
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.4,in short in that one athenian army as long as the seafight remained doubtful there was every sound to be heard at once shrieks cheers we win we lose and all the other manifold exclamations that a great host would necessarily utter in great peril
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.5,and with the men in the fleet it was nearly the same until at last the syracusans and their allies after the battle had lasted a long while put the athenians to flight and with much shouting and cheering chased them in open rout to the shore
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.6,the naval force one one way one another as many as were not taken afloat now ran ashore and rushed from on board their ships to their camp while the army no more divided but carried away by one impulse all with shrieks and groans deplored the event and ran down some to help the ships others to guard what was left of their wall while the remaining and most numerous part already began to consider how they should save themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.71.7,indeed the panic of the present moment had never been surpassed they now suffered very nearly what they had inflicted at pylos as then the lacedaemonians with the loss of their fleet lost also the men who had crossed over to the island so now the athenians had no hope of escaping by land without the help of some extraordinary accident
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.72.1,the seafight having been a severe one and many ships and lives having been lost on both sides the victorious syracusans and their allies now picked up their wrecks and dead and sailed off to the city and set up a trophy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.72.2,the athenians overwhelmed by their misfortune never even thought of asking leave to take up their dead or wrecks but wished to retreat that very night
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.72.3,demosthenes however went to nicias and gave it as his opinion that they should man the ships they had left and make another effort to force their passage out next morning saying that they had still left more ships fit for service than the enemy the athenians having about sixty remaining as against less than fifty of their opponents
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.72.4,nicias was quite of his mind but when they wished to man the vessels the sailors refused to go on board being so utterly overcome by their defeat as no longer to believe in the possibility of success
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.73.1,accordingly they all now made up their minds to retreat by land meanwhile the syracusan hermocrates suspecting their intention and impressed by the danger of allowing a force of that magnitude to retire by land establish itself in some other part of sicily and from thence renew the war went and stated his views to the authorities and pointed out to them that they ought not to let the enemy get away by night but that all the syracusans and their allies should at once march out and block up the roads and seize and guard the passes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.73.2,the authorities were entirely of his opinion and thought that it ought to be done but on the other hand felt sure that the people who had given themselves over to rejoicing and were taking their ease after a great battle at sea would not be easily brought to obey besides they were celebrating a festival having on that day a sacrifice to heracles and most of them in their rapture at the victory had fallen to drinking at the festival and would probably consent to anything sooner than to take up their arms and march out at that moment
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.73.3,for these reasons the thing appeared impracticable to the magistrates and hermocrates finding himself unable to do anything further with them had now recourse to the following stratagem of his own what he feared was that the athenians might quietly get the start of them by passing the most difficult places during the night and he therefore sent as soon as it was dusk some friends of his own to the camp with some horsemen who rode up within earshot and called out to some of the men as though they were wellwishers of the athenians and told them to tell nicias who had in fact some correspondence who informed him of what went on inside the town not to lead off the army by night as the syracusans were guarding the roads but to make his preparations at his leisure and to retreat by day
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.73.4,after saying this they departed and their hearers informed the athenian generals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.74.1,who put off going for that night on the strength of this message not doubting its sincerity since after all they had not set out at once they now determined to stay also the following day to give time to the soldiers to pack up as well as they could the most useful articles and leaving everything else behind to start only with what was strictly necessary for their personal subsistence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.74.2,meanwhile the syracusans and gylippus marched out and blocked up the roads through the country by which the athenians were likely to pass and kept guard at the fords of the stream and rivers posting themselves so as to receive them and stop the army where they thought best while their fleet sailed up to the beach and towed off the ships of the athenians some few were burned by the athenians themselves as they had intended the rest the syracusans lashed on to their own at their leisure as they had been thrown up on shore without any one trying to stop them and conveyed to the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.1,after this nicias and demosthenes now thinking that enough had been done in the way of preparation the removal of the army took place upon the second day after the seafight
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.2,it was a lamentable scene not merely from the single circumstance that they were retreating after having lost all their ships their great hopes gone and themselves and the state in peril but also in leaving the camp there were things most grievous for every eye and heart to contemplate
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.3,the dead lay unburied and each man as he recognized a friend among them shuddered with grief and horror while the living whom they were leaving behind wounded or sick were to the living far more shocking than the dead and more to be pitied than those who had perished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.4,these fell to entreating and bewailing until their friends knew not what to do begging them to take them and loudly calling to each individual comrade or relative whom they could see hanging upon the necks of their tentfellows in the act of departure and following as far as they could and when their bodily strength failed them calling again and again upon heaven and shrieking aloud as they were left behind so that the whole army being filled with tears and distracted after this fashion found it not easy to go even from an enemy s land where they had already suffered evils too great for tears and in the unknown future before them feared to suffer more
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.5,dejection and selfcondemnation were also rife among them indeed they could only be compared to a starvedout town and that no small one escaping the whole multitude upon the march being not less than forty thousand men all carried anything they could which might be of use and the heavy infantry and troopers contrary to their wont while under arms carried their own victuals in some cases for want of servants in others through not trusting them as they had long been deserting and now did so in greater numbers than ever yet even thus they did not carry enough as there was no longer food in the camp
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.6,moreover their disgrace generally and the universality of their sufferings however to a certain extent alleviated by being borne in company were still felt at the moment a heavy burden especially when they contrasted the splendor and glory of their setting out with the humiliation in which it had ended
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.75.7,for this was by far the greatest reverse that ever befell an hellenic army they had come to enslave others and were departing in fear of being enslaved themselves they had sailed out with prayer and paeans and now started to go back with omens directly contrary travelling by land instead of by sea and trusting not in their fleet but in their heavy infantry nevertheless the greatness of the danger still impending made all this appear tolerable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.76.1,nicias seeing the army dejected and greatly altered passed along the ranks and encouraged and comforted them as far as was possible under the circumstances raising his voice still higher and higher as he went from one company to another in his earnestness and in his anxiety that the benefit of his words might reach as many as possible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.77.1,athenians and allies even in our present position we must still hope on since men have ere now been saved from worse straits than this and you must not condemn yourselves too severely either because of your disasters or because of your present unmerited sufferings

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.77.4,others before us have attacked their neighbors and have done what men will do without suffering more than they could bear and we may now justly expect to find the gods more kind for we have become fitter objects for their pity than their jealousy and then look at yourselves mark the numbers and efficiency of the heavy infantry marching in your ranks and do not give way too much to despondency but reflect that you are yourselves at once a city wherever you sit down and that there is no other in sicily that could easily resist your attack or expel you when once established
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.77.5,the safety and order of the march is for yourselves to look to the one thought of each man being that the spot on which he may be forced to fight must be conquered and held as his country and stronghold
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.77.6,meanwhile we shall hasten on our way night and day alike as our provisions are scanty and if we can reach some friendly place of the sicels whom fear of the syracusans still keeps true to us you may forthwith consider yourselves safe a message has been sent on to them with directions to meet us with supplies of food
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.77.7,to sum up be convinced soldiers that you must be brave as there is no place near for your cowardice to take refuge in and that if you now escape from the enemy you may all see again what your hearts desire while those of you who are athenians will raise up again the great power of the state fallen though it be men make the city and not walls or ships without men in them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.78.1,as he made this address nicias went along the ranks and brought back to their place any of the troops that he saw straggling out of the line while demosthenes did as much for his part of the army addressing them in words very similar
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.78.2,the army marched in a hollow square the division under nicias leading and that of demosthenes following the heavy infantry being outside and the baggagecarriers and the bulk of the army in the middle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.78.3,when they arrived at the ford of the river anapus they there found drawn up a body of the syracusans and allies and routing these made good their passage and pushed on harassed by the charges of the syracusan horse and by the missiles of their light troops
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.78.4,on that day they advanced about four miles and a half halting for the night upon a certain hill on the next they started early and got on about two miles further and descended into a place in the plain and there encamped in order to procure some eatables from the houses as the place was inhabited and to carry on with them water from thence as for many furlongs in front in the direction in which they were going it was not plentiful
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.78.5,the syracusans meanwhile went on and fortified the pass in front where there was a steep hill with a rocky ravine on each side of it called the acraean cliff
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.78.6,the next day the athenians advancing found themselves impeded by the missiles and charges of the horse and darters both very numerous of the syracusans and allies and after fighting for a long while at length retired to the same camp where they had no longer provisions as before it being impossible to leave their position by reason of the cavalry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.79.1,early next morning they started afresh and forced their way to the hill which had been fortified where they found before them the enemy s infantry drawn up many shields deep to defend the fortification the pass being narrow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.79.2,the athenians assaulted the work but were greeted by a storm of missiles from the hill which told with the greater effect through its being a steep one and unable to force the passage retreated again and rested
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.79.3,meanwhile occurred some claps of thunder and rain as often happens towards autumn which still further disheartened the athenians who thought all these things to be omens of their approaching ruin
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.79.4,while they were resting gylippus and the syracusans sent a part of their army to throw up works in their rear on the way by which they had advanced however the athenians immediately sent some of their men and prevented them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.79.5,after which they retreated more towards the plain and halted for the night when they advanced the next day the syracusans surrounded and attacked them on every side and disabled many of them falling back if the athenians advanced and coming on if they retired and in particular assaulting their rear in the hope of routing them in detail and thus striking a panic into the whole army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.79.6,for a long while the athenians persevered in this fashion but after advancing for four or five furlongs halted to rest in the plain the syracusans also withdrawing to their own camp
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.80.1,during the night nicias and demosthenes seeing the wretched condition of their troops now in want of every kind of necessary and numbers of them disabled in the numerous attacks of the enemy determined to light as many fires as possible and to lead off the army no longer by the same route as they had intended but towards the sea in the opposite direction to that guarded by the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.80.2,the whole of this route was leading the army not to catana but to the other side of sicily towards camarina gela and the other hellenic and barbarian towns in that quarter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.80.3,they accordingly lit a number of fires and set out by night now all armies and the greatest most of all are liable to fears and alarms especially when they are marching by night through an enemy s country and with the enemy near and the athenians falling into one of these panics
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.80.4,the leading division that of nicias kept together and got on a good way in front while that of demosthenes comprising rather more than half the army got separated and marched on in some disorder
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.80.5,by morning however they reached the sea and getting into the helorine road pushed on in order to reach the river cacyparis and to follow the stream up through the interior where they hoped to be met by the sicels whom they had sent for
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.80.6,arrived at the river they found there also a syracusan party engaged in barring the passage of the ford with a wall and a palisade and forcing this guard crossed the river and went on to another called the erineus according to the advice of their guides
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.81.1,meanwhile when day came and the syracusans and allies found that the athenians were gone most of them accused gylippus of having let them escape on purpose and hastily pursuing by the road which they had no difficulty in finding that they had taken overtook them about dinnertime
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.81.2,they first came up with the troops under demosthenes who were behind and marching somewhat slowly and in disorder owing to the nightpanic above referred to and at once attacked and engaged them the syracusan horse surrounding them with more ease now that they were separated from the rest and hemming them in on one spot
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.81.3,the division of nicias was five or six miles on in front as he led them more rapidly thinking that under the circumstances their safety lay not in staying and fighting unless obliged but in retreating as fast as possible and only fighting when forced to do so
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.81.4,on the other hand demosthenes was generally speaking harassed more incessantly as his post in the rear left him the first exposed to the attacks of the enemy and now finding that the syracusans were in pursuit he omitted to push on in order to form his men for battle and so lingered until he was surrounded by his pursuers and himself and the athenians with him placed in the most distressing position being huddled into an enclosure with a wall all round it a road on this side and on that and olivetrees in great number where missiles were showered in upon them from every quarter
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.81.5,this mode of attack the syracusans had with good reason adopted in preference to fighting at close quarters as to risk a struggle with desperate men was now more for the advantage of the athenians than for their own besides their success had now become so certain that they began to spare themselves a little in order not to be cut off in the moment of victory thinking too that as it was they would be able in this way to subdue and capture the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.82.1,in fact after plying the athenians and allies all day long from every side with missiles they at length saw that they were worn out with their wounds and other sufferings and gylippus and the syracusans and their allies made a proclamation offering their liberty to any of the islanders who chose to come over to them and some few cities went over
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.82.2,afterwards a capitulation was agreed upon for all the rest with demosthenes to lay down their arms on condition that no one was to be put to death either by violence or imprisonment or want of the necessaries of life
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.82.3,upon this they surrendered to the number of six thousand in all laying down all the money in their possession which filled the hollows of four shields and were immediately conveyed by the syracusans to the town meanwhile nicias with his division arrived that day at the river erineus crossed over and posted his army upon some high ground upon the other side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.83.1,the next day the syracusans overtook him and told him that the troops under demosthenes had surrendered and invited him to follow their example incredulous of the fact nicias asked for a truce to send a horseman to see
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.83.2,and upon the return of the messenger with the tidings that they had surrendered sent a herald to gylippus and the syracusans saying that he was ready to agree with them on behalf of the athenians to repay whatever money the syracusans had spent upon the war if they would let his army go and offered until the money was paid to give athenians as hostages one for every talent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.83.3,the syracusans and gylippus rejected this proposition and attacked this division as they had the other standing all round and plying them with missiles until the evening
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.83.4,food and necessaries were as miserably wanting to the troops of nicias as they had been to their comrades nevertheless they watched for the quiet of the night to resume their march but as they were taking up their arms the syracusans perceived it and raised their paean

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.84.1,as soon as it was day nicias put his army in motion pressed as before by the syracusans and their allies pelted from every side by their missiles and struck down by their javelins
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.84.2,the athenians pushed on for the assinarus impelled by the attacks made upon them from every side by a numerous cavalry and the swarm of other arms fancying that they should breathe more freely if once across the river and driven on also by their exhaustion and craving for water
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.84.3,once there they rushed in and all order was at an end each man wanting to cross first and the attacks of the enemy making it difficult to cross at all forced to huddle together they fell against and trod down one another some dying immediately upon the javelins others getting entangled together and stumbling over the articles of baggage without being able to rise again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.84.4,meanwhile the opposite bank which was steep was lined by the syracusans who showered missiles down upon the athenians most of them drinking greedily and heaped together in disorder in the hollow bed of the river
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.84.5,the peloponnesians also came down and butchered them especially those in the water which was thus immediately spoiled but which they went on drinking just the same mud and all bloody as it was most even fighting to have it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.85.1,at last when many dead now lay piled one upon another in the stream and part of the army had been destroyed at the river and the few that escaped from thence cut off by the cavalry nicias surrendered himself to gylippus whom he trusted more than he did the syracusans and told him and the lacedaemonians to do what they liked with him but to stop the slaughter of the soldiers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.85.2,gylippus after this immediately gave orders to make prisoners upon which the rest were brought together alive except a large number secreted by the soldiery and a party was sent in pursuit of the three hundred who had got through the guard during the night and who were now taken with the rest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.85.3,the number of the enemy collected as public property was not considerable but that secreted was very large and all sicily was filled with them no convention having been made in their case as for those taken with demosthenes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.85.4,besides this a large portion were killed outright the carnage being very great and not exceeded by any in this sicilian war in the numerous other encounters upon the march not a few also had fallen nevertheless many escaped some at the moment others served as slaves and then ran away subsequently these found refuge at catana
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.86.1,the syracusans and their allies now mustered and took up the spoils and as many prisoners as they could and went back to the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.86.2,the rest of their athenian and allied captives were deposited in the quarries this seeming the safest way of keeping them but nicias and demosthenes were butchered against the will of gylippus who thought that it would be the crown of his triumph if he could take the enemy s generals to lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.86.3,one of them as it happened demosthenes was one of her greatest enemies on account of the affair of the island and of pylos while the other nicias was for the same reasons one of her greatest friends owing to his exertions to procure the release of the prisoners by persuading the athenians to make peace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.86.4,for these reasons the lacedaemonians felt kindly towards him and it was in this that nicias himself mainly confided when he surrendered to gylippus but some of the syracusans who had been in correspondence with him were afraid it was said of his being put to the torture and troubling their success by his revelations others especially the corinthians of his escaping as he was wealthy by means of bribes and living to do them further mischief and these persuaded the allies and put him to death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.86.5,this or the like was the cause of the death of a man who of all the hellenes in my time least deserved such a fate seeing that the whole course of his life had been regulated with strict attention to virtue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.87.1,the prisoners in the quarries were at first hardly treated by the syracusans crowded in a narrow hole without any roof to cover them the heat of the sun and the stifling closeness of the air tormented them during the day and then the nights which came on autumnal and chilly made them ill by the violence of the change
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.87.2,besides as they had to do everything in the same place for want of room and the bodies of those who died of their wounds or from the variation in the temperature or from similar causes were left heaped together one upon another intolerable stenches arose while hunger and thirst never ceased to afflict them each man during eight months having only half a pint of water and a pint of corn given him daily in short no single suffering to be apprehended by men thrust into such a place was spared them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.87.3,for some seventy days they thus lived all together after which all except the athenians and any siceliots or italiots who had joined in the expedition were sold
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.87.4,the total number of prisoners taken it would be difficult to state exactly but it could not have been less than seven thousand
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.87.5,this was the greatest hellenic achievement of any in this war or in my opinion in hellenic history at once most glorious to the victors and most calamitous to the conquered
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:7.87.6,they were beaten at all points and altogether all that they suffered was great they were destroyed as the saying is with a total destruction their fleet their army everything was destroyed and few out of many returned home such were the events in sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.1.1,such were the events in sicily when the news was brought to athens for a long while they disbelieved even the most respectable of the soldiers who had themselves escaped from the scene of action and clearly reported the matter a destruction so complete not being thought credible when the conviction was forced upon them they were angry with the orators who had joined in promoting the expedition just as if they had not themselves voted it and were enraged also with the reciters of oracles and soothsayers and all other omenmongers of the time who had encouraged them to hope that they should conquer sicily
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.1.2,already distressed at all points and in all quarters after what had now happened they were seized by a fear and consternation quite without example it was grievous enough for the state and for every man in his proper person to lose so many heavy infantry cavalry and ablebodied troops and to see none left to replace them but when they saw also that they had not sufficient ships in their docks or money in the treasury or crews for the ships they began to despair of salvation they thought that their enemies in sicily would immediately sail with their fleet against piraeus inflamed by so signal a victory while their adversaries at home redoubling all their preparations would vigorously attack them by sea and land at once aided by their own revolted confederates
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.1.3,nevertheless with such means as they had it was determined to resist to the last and to provide timber and money and to equip a fleet as they best could to take steps to secure their confederates and above all euboea to reform things in the city upon a more economical footing and to elect a board of elders to advise upon the state of affairs as occasion should arise
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.1.4,in short as is the way of a democracy in the panic of the moment they were ready to be as prudent as possible these resolves were at once carried into effect
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.2.1,summer was now over the winter ensuing saw all hellas stirring under the impression of the great athenian disaster in sicily neutrals now felt that even if uninvited they ought no longer to stand aloof from the war but should volunteer to march against the athenians who as they severally reflected would probably have come against them if the sicilian campaign had succeeded besides they considered that the war would now be short and that it would be creditable for them to take part in it meanwhile the allies of the lacedaemonians felt all more anxious than ever to see a speedy end to their heavy labours
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.2.2,but above all the subjects of the athenians showed a readiness to revolt even beyond their ability judging the circumstances with passion and refusing even to hear of the athenians being able to last out the coming summer
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.2.3,beyond all this lacedaemon was encouraged by the near prospect of being joined in great force in the spring by her allies in sicily lately forced by events to acquire their navy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.2.4,with these reasons for confidence in every quarter the lacedaemonians now resolved to throw themselves without reserve into the war considering that once it was happily terminated they would be finally delivered from such dangers as that which would have threatened them from athens if she had become mistress of sicily and that the overthrow of the athenians would leave them in quiet enjoyment of the supremacy over all hellas
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.3.1,their king agis accordingly set out at once during this winter with some troops from decelea and levied from the allies contributions for the fleet and turning towards the malian gulf exacted a sum of money from the oetaeans by carrying off most of their cattle in reprisal for their old hostility and in spite of the protests and opposition of the thessalians forced the achaeans of phthiotis and the other subjects of the thessalians in those parts to give him money and hostages and deposited the hostages at corinth and tried to bring their countrymen into the confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.3.2,the lacedaemonians now issued a requisition to the cities for building a hundred ships fixing their own quota and that of the boeotians at twentyfive each that of the phocians and locrians together at fifteen that of the corinthians at fifteen that of the arcadians pellenians and sicyonians together at ten and that of the megarians troezenians epidaurians and hermionians together at ten also and meanwhile made every other preparation for commencing hostilities by the spring
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.4.1,in the meantime the athenians were not idle during this same winter as they had determined they contributed timber and pushed on their shipbuilding and fortified sunium to enable their cornships to round it in safety and evacuated the fort in laconia which they had built on their way to sicily while they also for economy cut down any other expenses that seemed unnecessary and above all kept a careful lookout against the revolt of their confederates
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.5.1,while both parties were thus engaged and were as intent upon preparing for the war as they had been at the outset the euboeans first of all sent envoys during this winter to agis to treat of their revolting from athens agis accepted their proposals and sent for alcamenes son of sthenelaidas and melanthus from lacedaemon to take the command in euboea these accordingly arrived with some three hundred neodamodes and agis began to arrange for their crossing over
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.5.2,but in the meanwhile arrived some lesbians who also wished to revolt and these being supported by the boeotians agis was persuaded to defer acting in the matter of euboea and made arrangements for the revolt of the lesbians giving them alcamenes who was to have sailed to euboea as governor and himself promising them ten ships and the boeotians the same number
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.5.3,all this was done without instructions from home as agis while at decelea with the army that he commanded had power to send troops to whatever quarter he pleased and to levy men and money during this period one might say the allies obeyed him much more than they did the lacedaemonians in the city as the force he had with him made him feared at once wherever he went
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.5.4,while agis was engaged with the lesbians the chians and erythraeans who were also ready to revolt applied not to him but at lacedaemon where they arrived accompanied by an ambassador from tissaphernes the commander of king darius son of artaxerxes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.5.5,in the maritime districts who invited the peloponnesians to come over and promised to maintain their army the king had lately called upon him for the tribute from his government for which he was in arrears being unable to raise it from the hellenic towns by reason of the athenians and he therefore calculated that by weakening the athenians he should get the tribute better paid and should also draw the lacedaemonians into alliance with the king and by this means as the king had commanded him take alive or dead amorges the bastard son of pissuthnes who was in rebellion on the coast of caria
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.6.1,while the chians and tissaphernes thus joined to effect the same object about the same time calligeitus son of laophon a megarian and timagoras son of athenagoras a cyzicene both of them exiles from their country and living at the court of pharnabazus son of pharnaces arrived at lacedaemon upon a mission from pharnabazus to procure a fleet for the hellespont by means of which if possible he might himself effect the object of tissaphernes ambition and cause the cities in his government to revolt from the athenians and so get the tribute and by his own agency obtain for the king the alliance of the lacedaemonians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.6.2,the emissaries of pharnabazus and tissaphernes treating apart a keen competition now ensued at lacedaemon as to whether a fleet and army should be sent first to ionia and chios or to the hellespont
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.6.3,the lacedaemonians however decidedly favoured the chians and tissaphernes who were seconded by alcibiades the family friend of endius one of the ephors for that year indeed this is how their house got its laconic name alcibiades being the family name of endius
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.6.4,nevertheless the lacedaemonians first sent to chios phrynis one of the perioeci to see whether they had as many ships as they said and whether their city generally was as great as was reported and upon his bringing word that they had been told the truth immediately entered into alliance with the chians and erythraeans and voted to send them forty ships there being already according to the statement of the chians not less than sixty in the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.6.5,at first the lacedaemonians meant to send ten of these forty themselves with melanchridas their admiral but afterwards an earthquake having occurred they sent chalcideus instead of melanchridas and instead of the ten ships equipped only five in laconia and the winter ended and with it ended also the nineteenth year of this war of which thucydides is the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.7.1,at the beginning of the next summer the chians were urging that the fleet should be sent off being afraid that the athenians from whom all these embassies were kept a secret might find out what was going on and the lacedaemonians at once sent three spartans to corinth to haul the ships as quickly as possible across the isthmus from the other sea to that on the side of athens and to order them all to sail to chios those which agis was equipping for lesbos not excepted the number of ships from the allied states was thirtynine in all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.8.1,meanwhile calligeitus and timagoras did not join on behalf of pharnabazus in the expedition to chios or give the money twentyfive talents which they had brought with them to help in despatching a force but determined to sail afterwards with another force by themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.8.2,agis on the other hand seeing the lacedaemonians bent upon going to chios first himself came in to their views and the allies assembled at corinth and held a council in which they decided to sail first to chios under the command of chalcideus who was equipping the five vessels in laconia then to lesbos under the command of alcamenes the same whom agis had fixed upon and lastly to go to the hellespont where the command was given to clearchus son of ramphias
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.8.3,meanwhile they would take only half the ships across the isthmus first and let those sail off at once in order that the athenians might attend less to the departing squadron than to those to be taken across afterwards
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.8.4,as no care had been taken to keep this voyage secret through contempt of the impotence of the athenians who had as yet no fleet of any account upon the sea agreeably to this determination twentyone vessels were at once conveyed across the isthmus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.9.1,they were now impatient to set sail but the corinthians were not willing to accompany them until they had celebrated the isthmian festival which fell at that time upon this agis proposed to them to save their scruples about breaking the isthmian truce by taking the expedition upon himself
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.9.2,the corinthians not consenting to this a delay ensued during which the athenians conceived suspicions of what was preparing at chios and sent aristocrates one of their generals and charged them with the fact and upon the denial of the chians ordered them to send with them a contingent of ships as faithful confederates seven were sent accordingly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.9.3,the reason of the despatch of the ships lay in the fact that the mass of the chians were not privy to the negotiations while the few who were in the secret did not wish to break with the multitude until they had something positive to lean upon and no longer expected the peloponnesians to arrive by reason of their delay
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.10.1,in the meantime the isthmian games took place and the athenians who had been also invited went to attend them and now seeing more clearly into the designs of the chians as soon as they returned to athens took measures to prevent the fleet putting out from cenchreae without their knowledge
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.10.2,after the festival the peloponnesians set sail with twentyone ships for chios under the command of alcamenes the athenians first sailed against them with an equal number drawing off towards the open sea the enemy however turning back before he had followed them far the athenians returned also not trusting the seven chian ships which formed part of their number
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.10.3,and afterwards manned thirtyseven vessels in all and chased him on his passage along shore into spiraeum a desert corinthian port on the edge of the epidaurian frontier after losing one ship out at sea the peloponnesians got the rest together and brought them to anchor
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.10.4,the athenians now attacked not only from the sea with their fleet but also disembarked upon the coast and melee ensued of the most confused and violent kind in which the athenians disabled most of the enemy s vessels and killed alcamenes their commander losing also a few of their own men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.11.1,after this they separated and the athenians detaching a sufficient number of ships to blockade those of the enemy anchored with the rest at the islet adjacent upon which they proceeded to encamp and sent to athens for reinforcements
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.11.2,the peloponnesians having been joined on the day after the battle by the corinthians who came to help the ships and by the other inhabitants in the vicinity not long afterwards these saw the difficulty of keeping guard in a desert place and in their perplexity at first thought of burning the ships but finally resolved to haul them up on shore and sit down and guard them with their land forces until a convenient opportunity for escaping should present itself agis also on being informed of the disaster sent them a spartan of the name of thermon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.11.3,the lacedaemonians first received the news of the fleet having put out from the isthmus alcamenes having been ordered by the ephors to send off a horseman when this took place and immediately resolved to despatch their own five vessels under chalcideus and alcibiades with him but while they were full of this resolution came the second news of the fleet having taken refuge in spiraeum and disheartened at their first step in the ionian war proving a failure they laid aside the idea of sending the ships from their own country and even wished to recall some that had already sailed
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.12.1,perceiving this alcibiades again persuaded endius and the other ephors to persevere in the expedition saying that the voyage would be made before the chians heard of the fleet s misfortune and that as soon as he set foot in ionia he should by assuring them of the weakness of the athenians and the zeal of lacedaemon have no difficulty in persuading the cities to revolt as they would readily believe his testimony
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.12.2,he also represented to endius himself in private that it would be glorious for him to be the means of making ionia revolt and the king become the ally of lacedaemon instead of that honour being left to agis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.12.3,agis it must be remembered was the enemy of alcibiades and endius and his colleagues thus persuaded he put to sea with the five ships and the lacedaemonian chalcideus and made all haste upon the voyage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.13.1,about this same time the sixteen peloponnesian ships from sicily which had served through the war with gylippus were caught on their return off leucadia and roughly handled by the twentyseven athenian vessels under hippocles son of menippus on the lookout for the ships from sicily after losing one of their number the rest escaped from the athenians and sailed into corinth
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.14.1,meanwhile chalcideus and alcibiades seized all they met with on their voyage to prevent news of their coming and let them go at corycus the first point which they touched at in the continent here they were visited by some of their chian correspondents and being urged by them to sail up to the town without announcing their coming arrived suddenly before chios
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.14.2,the many were amazed and confounded while the few had so arranged that the council should be sitting at the time and after speeches from chalcideus and alcibiades stating that many more ships were sailing up but saying nothing of the fleet being blockaded in spiraeum the chians revolted from the athenians and the erythraeans immediately afterwards
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.14.3,after this three vessels sailed over to clazomenae and made that city revolt also and the clazomenians immediately crossed over to the mainland and began to fortify polichna in order to retreat there in case of necessity from the island where they dwelt
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.15.1,while the revolted places were all engaged in fortifying and preparing for the war news of chios speedily reached athens the athenians thought the danger by which they were now menaced great and unmistakable and that the rest of their allies would not consent to keep quiet after the secession of the greatest of their number in the consternation of the moment they at once took off the penalty attaching to whoever proposed or put to the vote a proposal for using the thousand talents which they had jealously avoided touching throughout the whole war and voted to employ them to man a large number of ships and to send off at once under strombichides son of diotimus the eight vessels forming part of the blockading fleet at spiraeum which had left the blockade and had returned after pursuing and failing to overtake the vessels with chalcideus these were to be followed shortly afterwards by twelve more under thrasycles also taken from the blockade
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.15.2,they also recalled the seven chian vessels forming part of their squadron blockading the fleet in spiraeum and giving the slaves on board their liberty put the freemen in confinement and speedily manned and sent out ten fresh ships to blockade the peloponnesians in the place of all those that had departed and decided to man thirty more zeal was not wanting and no effort was spared to send relief to chios
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.16.1,in the meantime strombichides with his eight ships arrived at samos and taking one samian vessel sailed to teos and required them to remain quiet chalcideus also set sail with twentythree ships for teos from chios the land forces of the clazomenians and erythraeans moving along shore to support him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.16.2,informed of this in time strombichides put out from teos before their arrival and while out at sea seeing the number of the ships from chios fled towards samos chased by the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.16.3,the teians at first would not receive the land forces but upon the flight of the athenians took them into the town there they waited for some time for chalcideus to return from the pursuit and as time went on without his appearing began themselves to demolish the wall which the athenians had built on the land side of the city of the teians being assisted by a few of the barbarians who had come up under the command of stages the lieutenant of tissaphernes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.17.1,meanwhile chalcideus and alcibiades after chasing strombichides into samos armed the crews of the ships from peloponnese and left them at chios and filling their places with substitutes from chios and manning twenty others sailed off to effect the revolt of miletus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.17.2,the wish of alcibiades who had friends among the leading men of the milesians was to bring over the town before the arrival of the ships from peloponnese and thus by causing the revolt of as many cities as possible with the help of the chian power and of chalcideus to secure the honour for the chians and himself and chalcideus and as he had promised for endius who had sent them out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.17.3,not discovered until their voyage was nearly completed they arrived a little before strombichides and thrasycles who had just come with twelve ships from athens and had joined strombichides in pursuing them and occasioned the revolt of miletus the athenians sailing up close on their heels with nineteen ships found miletus closed against them and took up their station at the adjacent island of lade
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.17.4,the first alliance between the king and the lacedaemonians was now concluded immediately upon the revolt of the milesians by tissaphernes and chalcideus and was as follows
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.18.1,the lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty with the king and tissaphernes upon the terms following whatever country or cities the king has or the king s ancestors had shall be the king s and whatever came in to the athenians from these cities either money or any other thing the king and the lacedaemonians and their allies shall jointly hinder the athenians from receiving either money or any other thing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.18.2,the war with the athenians shall be carried on jointly by the king and by the lacedaemonians and their allies and it shall not be lawful to make peace with the athenians except both agree the king on his side and the lacedaemonians and their allies on theirs
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.18.3,if any revolt from the king they shall be the enemies of the lacedaemonians and their allies and if any revolt from the lacedaemonians and their allies they shall be the enemies of the king in like manner

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.21.1,about this time took place the rising of the commons at samos against the upper classes in concert with some athenians who were there in three vessels the samian commons put to death some two hundred in all of the upper classes and banished four hundred more and themselves took their land and houses after which the athenians decreed their independence being now sure of their fidelity and the commons henceforth governed the city excluding the landholders from all share in affairs and forbidding any of the commons to give his daughter in marriage to them or to take a wife from them in future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.22.1,after this during the same summer the chians whose zeal continued as active as ever and who even without the peloponnesians found themselves in sufficient force to effect the revolt of the cities and also wished to have as many companions in peril as possible made an expedition with thirteen ships of their own to lesbos the instructions from lacedaemon being to go to that island next and from thence to the hellespont meanwhile the land forces of the peloponnesians who were with the chians and of the allies on the spot moved along shore for clazomenae and cuma under the command of eualas a spartan while the fleet under diniades one of the perioeci

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.23.1,in the meantime astyochus the lacedaemonian admiral set sail from cenchreae with four ships as he had intended and arrived at chios on the third day after his arrival the athenian ships twentyfive in number sailed to lesbos under diomedon and leon who had lately arrived with a reinforcement of ten ships from athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.23.2,late in the same day astyochus put to sea and taking one chian vessel with him sailed to lesbos to render what assistance he could arrived at pyrrha and from thence the next day at eresus he there learned that mitylene had been taken almost without a blow by the athenians

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.23.5,as however everything went against him in lesbos he took up his own force and sailed back to chios the land forces on board which were to have gone to the hellespont being also conveyed back to their different cities after this six of the allied peloponnesian ships at cenchreae joined the forces at chios
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.23.6,the athenians after restoring matters to their old state in lesbos set sail from thence and took polichna the place that the clazomenians were fortifying on the continent and carried the inhabitants back to their town upon the island except the authors of the revolt who withdrew to daphnus and thus clazomenae became once more athenian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.24.1,the same summer the athenians in the twenty ships at lade blockading miletus made a descent at panormus in the milesian territory and killed chalcideus the lacedaemonian commander who had come with a few men against them and the third day after sailed over and set up a trophy which as they were not masters of the country was however pulled down by the milesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.24.2,meanwhile leon and diomedon with the athenian fleet from lesbos issuing from the oelacedaenussae the isles off chios and from their forts of sidussa and pteleum in the erythraeid and from lesbos carried on the war against the chians from the ships having on board heavy infantry from the rolls pressed to serve as marines

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.24.4,indeed after the lacedaemonians the chians are the only people that i have known who knew how to be wise in prosperity and who ordered their city the more securely the greater it grew
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.24.5,nor was this revolt in which they might seem to have erred on the side of rashness ventured upon until they had numerous and gallant allies to share the danger with them and until they perceived the athenians after the sicilian disaster themselves no longer denying the thoroughly desperate state of their affairs and if they were thrown out by one of the surprises which upset human calculations they found out their mistake in company with many others who believed like them in the speedy collapse of the athenian power
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.24.6,while they were thus blockaded from the sea and plundered by land some of the citizens undertook to bring the city over to the athenians appraised of this the authorities took no action themselves but brought astyochus the admiral from erythrae with four ships that he had with him and considered how they could most quietly either by taking hostages or by some other means put an end to the conspiracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.25.1,while the chians were thus engaged a thousand athenian heavy infantry and fifteen hundred argives five hundred of whom were light troops furnished with armour by the athenians and one thousand of the allies towards the close of the same summer sailed from athens in fortyeight ships some of which were transports under the command of phrynichus onomacles and scironides and putting in to samos crossed over and encamped at miletus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.25.2,upon this the milesians came out to the number of eight hundred heavy infantry with the peloponnesians who had come with chalcideus and some foreign mercenaries of tissaphernes tissaphernes himself and his cavalry and engaged the athenians and their allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.25.3,while the argives rushed forward on their own wing with the careless disdain of men advancing against ionians who would never stand their charge and were defeated by the milesians with a loss little short of three hundred men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.25.4,the athenians first defeated the peloponnesians and driving before them the barbarians and the ruck of the army without engaging the milesians who after the rout of the argives retreated into the town upon seeing their comrades worsted crowned their victory by grounding their arms under the very walls of miletus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.25.5,thus in this battle the ionians on both sides overcame the dorians the athenians defeating the peloponnesians opposed to them and the milesians the argives after setting up a trophy the athenians prepared to draw a wall round the place which stood upon an isthmus thinking that if they could gain miletus the other towns also would easily come over to them

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.27.1,accordingly they resolved to relieve it the next morning meanwhile phrynichus the athenian commander had received precise intelligence of the fleet from leros and when his colleagues expressed a wish to keep the sea and fight it out flatly refused either to stay himself or to let them or any one else do so if he could help it

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.27.3,it was no disgrace for an athenian fleet to retreat when it suited them put it as they would it would be more disgraceful to be beaten and to expose the city not only to disgrace but to the most serious danger after its late misfortunes it could hardly be justified in voluntarily taking the offensive even with the strongest force except in a case of absolute necessity much less then without compulsion could it rush upon peril of its own seeking
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.27.4,he told them to take up their wounded as quickly as they could and the troops and stores which they had brought with them and leaving behind what they had taken from the enemy s country in order to lighten the ships to sail off to samos and there concentrating all their ships to attack as opportunity served
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.27.5,as he spoke so he acted and thus not now more than afterwards nor in this alone but in all that he had to do with did phrynichus show himself a man of sense
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.27.6,in this way that very evening the athenians broke up from before miletus leaving their victory unfinished and the argives mortified at their disaster promptly sailed off home from samos

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.41.3,from cos arriving in the night at cnidus he was constrained by the representations of the cnidians not to disembark the sailors but to sail as he was straight against the twenty athenian vessels which with charminus one of the commanders at samos were on the watch for the very twentyseven ships from peloponnese which astyochus was himself sailing to join
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.41.4,the athenians in samos having heard from melos of their approach and charminus being on the lookout off syme chalce rhodes and lycia as he now heard that they were at caunus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.42.1,astyochus accordingly sailed as he was to syme before he was heard of in the hope of catching the enemy somewhere out at sea rain however and foggy weather encountered him and caused his ships to straggle and get into disorder in the dark
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.42.2,in the morning his fleet had parted company and was most of it still straggling round the island and the left wing only in sight of charminus and the athenians who took it for the squadron which they were watching for from caunus and hastily put out against it with part only of their twenty vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.42.3,and attacking immediately sank three ships and disabled others and had the advantage in the action until the main body of the fleet unexpectedly hove in sight when they were surrounded on every side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.42.4,upon this they took to flight and after losing six ships with the rest escaped to teutlussa or beet island and from thence to halicarnassus after this the peloponnesians put into cnidus and being joined by the twentyseven ships from caunus sailed all together and set up a trophy in syme and then returned to anchor at cnidus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.43.1,as soon as the athenians knew of the seafight they sailed with all the ships at samos to syme and without attacking or being attacked by the fleet at cnidus took the ships tackle left at syme and touching at lorymi on the main land sailed back to samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.43.2,meanwhile the peloponnesian ships being now all at cnidus underwent such repairs as were needed while the eleven lacedaemonian commissioners conferred with tissaphernes who had come to meet them upon the points which did not satisfy them in the past transactions and upon the best and mutually most advantageous manner of conducting the war in future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.43.3,the severest critic of the present proceeding was lichas who said that neither of the treaties could stand neither that of chalcideus nor that of therimenes it being monstrous that the king should at this date pretend to the possession of all country formerly ruled by himself or by his ancestors a pretension which implicitly put back under the yoke all the islands thessaly locris and everything as far as boeotia and made the lacedaemonians give to the hellenes instead of liberty a median master
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.43.4,he therefore invited tissaphernes to conclude another and a better treaty as they certainly would not recognise those existing and did not want any of his pay upon such conditions this offended tissaphernes so much that he went away in a rage without settling anything
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.44.1,the peloponnesians now determined to sail to rhodes upon the invitation of some of the principal men there hoping to gain an island powerful by the number of its seamen and by its land forces and also thinking that they would be able to maintain their fleet from their own confederacy without having to ask for money from tissaphernes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.44.2,they accordingly at once set sail that same winter from cnidus and first put in with ninetyfour ships at camirus in the rhodian country to the great alarm of the mass of the inhabitants who were not privy to the intrigue and who consequently fled especially as the town was unfortified they were afterwards however assembled by the lacedaemonians together with the inhabitants of the two other towns of lindus and ialysus and the rhodians were persuaded to revolt from the athenians and the island went over to the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.44.3,meanwhile the athenians had received the alarm and set sail with the fleet from samos to forestall them and came within sight of the island but being a little too late sailed off for the moment to chalce and from thence to samos and subsequently waged war against rhodes issuing from chalce cos and samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.44.4,the peloponnesians now levied a contribution of thirtytwo talents from the rhodians after which they hauled their ships ashore and for eighty days remained inactive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.45.1,during this time and even earlier before they removed to rhodes the following intrigues took place after the death of chalcideus and the battle at miletus alcibiades began to be suspected by the peloponnesians and astyochus received from lacedaemon an order from them to put him to death he being the personal enemy of agis and in other respects thought unworthy of confidence alcibiades in his alarm first withdrew to tissaphernes and immediately began to do all he could with him to injure the peloponnesian cause
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.45.2,henceforth becoming his adviser in everything he cut down the pay from an attic drachma to three obols a day and even this not paid too regularly and told tissaphernes to say to the peloponnesians that the athenians whose maritime experience was of an older date than their own only gave their men three obols not so much from poverty as to prevent their seamen being corrupted by being too well off and injuring their condition by spending money upon enervating indulgences and also paid their crews irregularly in order to have a security against their deserting in the arrears which they would leave behind them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.45.3,he also told tissaphernes to bribe the captains and generals of the cities and so to obtain their connivance an expedient which succeeded with all except the syracusans hermocrates alone opposing him on behalf of the whole confederacy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.45.4,meanwhile the cities asking for money alcibiades sent off by roundly telling them in the name of tissaphernes that it was great impudence in the chians the richest people in hellas not content with being defended by a foreign force to expect others to risk not only their lives but their money as well in behalf of their freedom
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.45.5,while the other cities he said had had to pay largely to athens before their rebellion and could not justly refuse to contribute as much or even more now for their own selves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.45.6,he also pointed out that tissaphernes was at present carrying on the war at his own charges and had good cause for economy but that as soon as he received remittances from the king he would give them their pay in full and do what was reasonable for the cities
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.46.1,alcibiades further advised tissaphernes not to be in too great a hurry to end the war or to let himself be persuaded to bring up the phoenician fleet which he was equipping or to provide pay for more hellenes and thus put the power by land and sea into the same hands but to leave each of the contending parties in possession of one element thus enabling the king when he found one troublesome to call in the other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.46.2,for if the command of the sea and land were united in one hand he would not know where to turn for help to overthrow the dominant power unless he at last chose to stand up himself and go through with the struggle at great expense and hazard the cheapest plan was to let the hellenes wear each other out at a small share of the expense and without risk to himself
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.46.3,besides he would find the athenians the most convenient partners in empire as they did not aim at conquests on shore and carried on the war upon principles and with a practice most advantageous to the king being prepared to combine to conquer the sea for athens and for the king all the hellenes inhabiting his country whom the peloponnesians on the contrary had come to liberate now it was not likely that the lacedaemonians would free the hellenes from the hellenic athenians without freeing them also from the barbarian mede unless overthrown by him in the meanwhile
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.46.4,alcibiades therefore urged him to wear them both out at first and after docking the athenian power as much as he could forthwith to rid the country of the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.46.5,in the main tissaphernes approved of this policy so far at least as could be conjectured from his behaviour since he now gave his confidence to alcibiades in recognition of his good advice and kept the peloponnesians short of money and would not let them fight at sea but ruined their cause by pretending that the phoenician fleet would arrive and that they would thus be enabled to contend with the odds in their favour and so made their navy lose its efficiency which had been very remarkable and generally betrayed a coolness in the war that was too plain to be mistaken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.47.1,alcibiades gave this advice to tissaphernes and the king with whom he then was not merely because he thought it really the best but because he was studying means to effect his restoration to his country well knowing that if he did not destroy it he might one day hope to persuade the athenians to recall him and thinking that his best chance of persuading them lay in letting them see that he possessed the favour of tissaphernes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.47.2,the event proved him to be right when the athenians at samos found that he had influence with tissaphernes principally of their own motion though partly also through alcibiades himself sending word to their chief men to tell the best men in the army that if there were only an oligarchy in the place of the rascally democracy that had banished him he would be glad to return to his country and to make tissaphernes their friend the captains and chief men in the armament at once embraced the idea of subverting the democracy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.1,the design was first mooted in the camp and afterwards from thence reached the city some persons crossed over from samos and had an interview with alcibiades who immediately offered to make first tissaphernes and afterwards the king their friend if they would give up the democracy and make it possible for the king to trust them the higher class who also suffered most severely from the war now conceived great hopes of getting the government into their own hands and of triumphing over the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.2,upon their return to samos the emissaries formed their partisans into a club and openly told the mass of the armament that the king would be their friend and would provide them with money if alcibiades were restored and the democracy abolished
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.3,the multitude if at first irritated by these intrigues were nevertheless kept quiet by the advantageous prospect of the pay from the king and the oligarchical conspirators after making this communication to the people now reexamined the proposals of alcibiades among themselves with most of their associates
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.4,unlike the rest who thought them advantageous and trustworthy phrynichus who was still general by no means approved of the proposals alcibiades he rightly thought cared no more for an oligarchy than for a democracy and only sought to change the institutions of his country in order to get himself recalled by his associates while for themselves their one object should be to avoid civil discord it was not the king s interest when the peloponnesians were now their equals at sea and in possession of some of the chief cities in his empire to go out of his way to side with the athenians whom he did not trust when he might make friends of the peloponnesians who had never injured him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.5,and as for the allied states to whom oligarchy was now offered because the democracy was to be put down at athens he well knew that this would not make the rebels come in any the sooner or confirm the loyal in their allegiance as the allies would never prefer servitude with an oligarchy or democracy to freedom with the constitution which they actually enjoyed to whichever type it belonged
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.6,besides the cities thought that the socalled better classes would prove just as oppressive as the commons as being those who originated proposed and for the most part benefited from the acts of the commons injurious to the confederates indeed if it depended on the better classes the confederates would be put to death without trial and with violence while the commons were their refuge and the chastiser of these men
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.48.7,this he positively knew that the cities had learned by experience and that such was their opinion the propositions of alcibiades and the intrigues now in progress could therefore never meet with his approval
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.49.1,however the members of the club assembled agreeably to their original determination accepted what was proposed and prepared to send pisander and others on an embassy to athens to treat for the restoration of alcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in the city and thus to make tissaphernes the friend of the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.50.1,phrynichus now saw that there would be a proposal to restore alcibiades and that the athenians would consent to it and fearing after what he had said against it that alcibiades if restored would revenge himself upon him for his opposition had recourse to the following expedient he sent a secret letter to the lacedaemonian admiral
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.50.2,astyochus who was still in the neighbourhood of miletus to tell him that alcibiades was ruining their cause by making tissaphernes the friend of the athenians and containing an express revelation of the rest of the intrigue desiring to be excused if he sought to harm his enemy even at the expense of the interests of his country
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.50.3,however astyochus instead of thinking of punishing alcibiades who besides no longer ventured within his reach as formerly went up to him and tissaphernes at magnesia communicated to them the letter from samos and turned informer and if report may be trusted became the paid creature of tissaphernes undertaking to inform him as to this and all other matters which was also the reason why he did not remonstrate more strongly against the pay not being given in full
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.50.4,upon this alcibiades instantly sent to the authorities at samos a letter against phrynichus stating what he had done and requiring that he should be put to death
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.50.5,phrynichus distracted and placed in the utmost peril by the denunciation sent again to astyochus reproaching him with having so ill kept the secret of his previous letter and saying that he was now prepared to give them an opportunity of destroying the whole athenian armament at samos giving a detailed account of the means which he should employ samos being unfortified and pleading that being in danger of his life on their account he could not now be blamed for doing this or anything else to escape being destroyed by his mortal enemies this also astyochus revealed to alcibiades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.51.1,meanwhile phrynichus having had timely notice that he was playing him false and that a letter on the subject was on the point of arriving from alcibiades himself anticipated the news and told the army that the enemy seeing that samos was unfortified and the fleet not all stationed within the harbour meant to attack the camp that he could be certain of this intelligence and that they must fortify samos as quickly as possible and generally look to their defences it will be remembered that he was general and had himself authority to carry out these measures
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.51.2,accordingly they addressed themselves to the work of fortification and samos was thus fortified sooner than it would otherwise have been not long afterwards came the letter from alcibiades saying that the army was betrayed by phrynichus and the enemy about to attack it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.51.3,alcibiades however gained no credit it being thought that he was in the secret of the enemy s designs and had tried to fasten them upon phrynichus and to make out that he was their accomplice out of hatred and consequently far from hurting him he rather bore witness to what he had said by this intelligence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.52.1,after this alcibiades set to work to persuade tissaphernes to become the friend of the athenians tissaphernes although afraid of the peloponnesians because they had more ships in asia than the athenians was yet disposed to be persuaded if he could especially after his quarrel with the peloponnesians at cnidus about the treaty of therimenes the quarrel had already taken place as the peloponnesians were by this time actually at rhodes and in it the original argument of alcibiades touching the liberation of all the towns by the lacedaemonians had been verified by the declaration of lichas that it was impossible to submit to a convention which made the king master of all the states at any former time ruled by himself or by his fathers while alcibiades was besieging the favour of tissaphernes with an earnestness proportioned to the greatness of the issue
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.53.1,the athenian envoys who had been despatched from samos with pisander arrived at athens and made a speech before the people giving a brief summary of their views and particularly insisting that if alcibiades were recalled and the democratic constitution changed they could have the king as their ally and would be able to overcome the peloponnesians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.53.2,a number of speakers opposed them on the question of the democracy the enemies of alcibiades cried out against the scandal of a restoration to be effected by a violation of the constitution and the eumolpidae and ceryces protested in behalf of the mysteries the cause of his banishment and called upon the gods to avert his recall when pisander in the midst of much opposition and abuse came forward and taking each of his opponents aside asked him the following question in the face of the fact that the peloponnesians had as many ships as their own confronting them at sea more cities in alliance with them and the king and tissaphernes to supply them with money of which the athenians had none left had he any hope of saving the state unless some one could induce the king to come over to their side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.53.3,upon their replying that they had not he then plainly said to them this we cannot have unless we have a more moderate form of government and put the offices into fewer hands and so gain the king s confidence and forthwith restore alcibiades who is the only man living that can bring this about the safety of the state not the form of its government is for the moment the most pressing question as we can always change afterwards whatever we do not like
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.54.1,the people were at first highly irritated at the mention of an oligarchy but upon understanding clearly from pisander that this was the only resource left they took counsel of their fears and promised themselves some day to change the government again and gave way
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.54.2,they accordingly voted that pisander should sail with ten others and make the best arrangement that they could with tissaphernes and alcibiades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.54.3,at the same time the people upon a false accusation of pisander dismissed phrynichus from his post together with his colleague scironides sending diomedon and leon to replace them in the command of the fleet the accusation was that phrynichus had betrayed iasus and amorges and pisander brought it because he thought him a man unfit for the business now in hand with alcibiades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.54.4,pisander also went the round of all the clubs already existing in the city for help in lawsuits and elections and urged them to draw together and to unite their efforts for the overthrow of the democracy and after taking all other measures required by the circumstances so that no time might be lost set off with his ten companions on his voyage to tissaphernes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.55.1,in the same winter leon and diomedon who had by this time joined the fleet made an attack upon rhodes the ships of the peloponnesians they found hauled up on shore and after making a descent upon the coast and defeating the rhodians who appeared in the field against them withdrew to chalce and made that place their base of operations instead of cos as they could better observe from thence if the peloponnesian fleet put out to sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.55.2,meanwhile xenophantes a laconian came to rhodes from pedaritus at chios with the news that the fortification of the athenians was now finished and that unless the whole peloponnesian fleet came to the rescue the cause in chios must be lost upon this they resolved to go to his relief
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.55.3,in the meantime pedaritus with the mercenaries that he had with him and the whole force of the chians made an assault upon the work round the athenian ships and took a portion of it and got possession of some vessels that were hauled up on shore when the athenians sallied out to the rescue and first routing the chians next defeated the remainder of the force round pedaritus who was himself killed with many of the chians a great number of arms being also taken
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.56.1,after this the chians were besieged even more straitly than before by land and sea and the famine in the place was great meanwhile the athenian envoys with pisander arrived at the court of tissaphernes and conferred with him about the proposed agreement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.56.2,however alcibiades not being altogether sure of tissaphernes who feared the peloponnesians more than the athenians and besides wished to wear out both parties as alcibiades himself had recommended had recourse to the following stratagem to make the treaty between the athenians and tissaphernes miscarry by reason of the magnitude of his demands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.56.3,in my opinion tissaphernes desired this result fear being his motive while alcibiades who now saw that tissaphernes was determined not to treat on any terms wished the athenians to think not that he was unable to persuade tissaphernes but that after the latter had been persuaded and was willing to join them they had not conceded enough to him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.56.4,for the demands of alcibiades speaking for tissaphernes who was present were so extravagant that the athenians although for a long while they agreed to whatever he asked yet had to bear the blame of failure he required the cession of the whole of ionia next of the islands adjacent besides other concessions and these passed without opposition at last in the third interview alcibiades who now feared a complete discovery of his inability required them to allow the king to build ships and sail along his own coast wherever and with as many as he pleased upon this the athenians would yield no further and concluding that there was nothing to be done but that they had been deceived by alcibiades went away in a passion and proceeded to samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.57.1,tissaphernes immediately after this in the same winter proceeded along shore to caunus desiring to bring the peloponnesian fleet back to miletus and to supply them with pay making a fresh convention upon such terms as he could get in order not to bring matters to an absolute breach between them he was afraid that if many of their ships were left without pay they would be compelled to engage and be defeated or that their vessels being left without hands the athenians would attain their objects without his assistance still more he feared that the peloponnesians might ravage the continent in search of supplies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.57.2,having calculated and considered all this agreeably to his plan of keeping the two sides equal he now sent for the peloponnesians and gave them pay and concluded with them a third treaty in words following
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.58.1,in the thirteenth year of the reign of darius while alexippidas was ephor at lacedaemon a convention was concluded in the plain of the moeander by the lacedaemonians and their allies with tissaphernes hieramenes and the sons of pharnaces concerning the affairs of the king and of the lacedaemonians and their allies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.58.2,the country of the king in asia shall be the king s and the king shall treat his own country as he pleases

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.58.4,if any of the lacedaemonians or of their allies invade or injure the king s country the lacedaemonians and their allies shall prevent it and if any from the king s country invade or injure the country of the lacedaemonians or of their allies the king shall prevent it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.58.5,tissaphernes shall provide pay for the ships now present according to the agreement until the arrival of the king s vessels
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.58.6,but after the arrival of the king s vessels the lacedaemonians and their allies may pay their own ships if they wish it if however they choose to receive the pay from tissaphernes tissaphernes shall furnish it and the lacedaemonians and their allies shall repay him at the end of the war such monies as they shall have received
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.58.7,after the king s vessels have arrived the ships of the lacedaemonians and of their allies and those of the king shall carry on the war jointly according as tissaphernes and the lacedaemonians and their allies shall think best if they wish to make peace with the athenians they shall make peace also jointly
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.59.1,this was the treaty after this tissaphernes prepared to bring up the phoenician fleet according to agreement and to make good his other promises or at all events wished to make it appear that he was so preparing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.60.1,winter was now drawing towards its close when the boeotians took oropus by treachery though held by an athenian garrison their accomplices in this were some of the eretrians and of the oropians themselves who were plotting the revolt of euboea as the place was exactly opposite eretria and while in athenian hands was necessarily a source of great annoyance to eretria and the rest of euboea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.60.2,oropus being in their hands the eretrians now came to rhodes to invite the peloponnesians into euboea the latter however were rather bent on the relief of the distressed chians and accordingly put out to sea and sailed with all their ships from rhodes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.60.3,off triopium they sighted the athenian fleet out at sea sailing from chalce and neither attacking the other arrived the latter at samos the peloponnesians at miletus seeing that it was no longer possible to relieve chios without a battle and this winter ended and with it ended the twentieth year of this war of which thucydides is the historian
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.61.1,early in the spring of the summer following dercyllidas a spartan was sent with a small force by land to the hellespont to effect the revolt of abydos which is a milesian colony and the chians while astyochus was at a loss how to help them were compelled to fight at sea by the pressure of the siege
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.61.2,while astyochus was still at rhodes they had received from miletus as their commander after the death of pedaritus a spartan named leon who had come out with antisthenes and twelve vessels which had been on guard at miletus five of which were thurian four syracusan one from anaia one milesian and one leon s own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.61.3,accordingly the chians marched out in mass and took up a strong position while thirtysix of their ships put out and engaged thirtytwo of the athenians and after a tough fight in which the chians and their allies had rather the best of it as it was now late retired to their city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.62.1,immediately after this dercyllidas arrived by land from miletus and abydos in the hellespont revolted to him and pharnabazus and lampsacus two days later
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.62.2,upon receipt of this news strombichides hastily sailed from chios with twentyfour athenian ships some transports carrying heavy infantry being of the number and defeating the lampsacenes who came out against him took lampsacus which was unfortified at the first assault and making prize of the slaves and goods restored the freemen to their homes and went on to abydos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.62.3,the inhabitants however refusing to capitulate and his assaults failing to take the place he sailed over to the coast opposite and appointed sestos the town in the chersonese held by the medes at a former period in this history as the centre for the defence of the whole hellespont
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.63.1,in the meantime the chians commanded the sea more than before and the peloponnesians at miletus and astyochus hearing of the seafight and of the departure of the squadron with strombichides took fresh courage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.63.2,coasting along with two vessels to chios astyochus took the ships from that place and now moved with the whole fleet upon samos from whence however he sailed back to miletus as the athenians did not put out against him owing to their suspicions of one another
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.63.3,for it was about this time or even before that the democracy was put down at athens when pisander and the envoys returned from tissaphernes to samos they at once strengthened still further their interest in the army itself and instigated the upper class in samos to join them in establishing an oligarchy the very form of government which a party of them had lately risen to avoid
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.63.4,at the same time the athenians at samos after a consultation among themselves determined to let alcibiades alone since he refused to join them and besides was not the man for an oligarchy and now that they were once embarked to see for themselves how they could best prevent the ruin of their cause and meanwhile to sustain the war and to contribute without stint money and all else that might be required from their own private estates as they would henceforth labour for themselves alone
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.64.1,after encouraging each other in these resolutions they now at once sent off half the envoys and pisander to do what was necessary at athens with instructions to establish oligarchies on their way in all the subject cities which they might touch at and despatched the other half in different directions to the other dependencies
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.64.2,diitrephes also who was in the neighbourhood of chios and had been elected to the command of the thracian towns was sent off to his government and arriving at thasos abolished the democracy there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.64.3,two months however had not elapsed after his departure before the thasians began to fortify their town being already tired of an aristocracy with athens and in daily expectation of freedom from lacedaemon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.64.4,indeed there was a party of them whom the athenians had banished with the peloponnesians who with their friends in the town were already making every exertion to bring a squadron and to effect the revolt of thasos and this party thus saw exactly what they most wanted done that is to say the reformation of the government without risk and the abolition of the democracy which would have opposed them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.64.5,things at thasos thus turned out just the contrary to what the oligarchical conspirators at athens expected and the same in my opinion was the case in many of the other dependencies as the cities no sooner got a moderate government and liberty of action than they went on to absolute freedom without being at all seduced by the show of reform offered by the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.65.1,pisander and his colleagues on their voyage along shore abolished as had been determined the democracies in the cities and also took some heavy infantry from certain places as their allies and so came to athens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.65.2,here they found most of the work already done by their associates some of the younger men had banded together and secretly assassinated one androcles the chief leader of the commons and mainly responsible for the banishment of alcibiades androcles being singled out both because he was a popular leader and because they sought by his death to recommend themselves to alcibiades who was as they supposed to be recalled and to make tissaphernes their friend there were also some other obnoxious persons whom they secretly did away with in the same manner
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.65.3,meanwhile their cry in public was that no pay should be given except to persons serving in the war and that not more than five thousand should share in the government and those such as were most able to serve the state in person and in purse
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.66.1,but this was a mere catchword for the multitude as the authors of the revolution were really to govern however the assembly and the council of the bean still met notwithstanding although they discussed nothing that was not approved of by the conspirators who both supplied the speakers and reviewed in advance what they were to say
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.66.2,fear and the sight of the numbers of the conspirators closed the mouths of the rest or if any ventured to rise in opposition he was presently put to death in some convenient way and there was neither search for the murderers nor justice to be had against them if suspected but the people remained motionless being so thoroughly cowed that men thought themselves lucky to escape violence even when they held their tongues
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.66.3,an exaggerated belief in the numbers of the conspirators also demoralised the people rendered helpless by the magnitude of the city and by their want of intelligence with each other and being without means of finding out what those numbers really were
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.66.4,for the same reason it was impossible for any one to open his grief to a neighbour and to concert measures to defend himself as he would have had to speak either to one whom he did not know or whom he knew but did not trust
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.66.5,indeed all the popular party approached each other with suspicion each thinking his neighbour concerned in what was going on the conspirators having in their ranks persons whom no one could ever have believed capable of joining an oligarchy and these it was who made the many so suspicious and so helped to procure impunity for the few by confirming the commons in their mistrust of one another
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.67.1,at this juncture arrived pisander and his colleagues who lost no time in doing the rest first they assembled the people and moved to elect ten commissioners with full powers to frame a constitution and that when this was done they should on an appointed day lay before the people their opinion as to the best mode of governing the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.67.2,afterwards when the day arrived the conspirators enclosed the assembly in colonus a temple of poseidon a little more than a mile outside the city when the commissioners simply brought forward this single motion that any athenian might propose with impunity whatever measure he pleased heavy penalties being imposed upon any who should indict for illegality or otherwise molest him for so doing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.67.3,the way thus cleared it was now plainly declared that all tenure of office and receipt of pay under the existing institutions were at an end and that five men must be elected as presidents who should in their turn elect one hundred and each of the hundred three apiece and that this body thus made up to four hundred should enter the council chamber with full powers and govern as they judged best and should convene the five thousand whenever they pleased
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.68.1,the man who moved this resolution was pisander who was throughout the chief ostensible agent in putting down the democracy but he who concerted the whole affair and prepared the way for the catastrophe and who had given the greatest thought to the matter was antiphon one of the best men of his day in athens who with a head to contrive measures and a tongue to recommend them did not willingly come forward in the assembly or upon any public scene being illlooked upon by the multitude owing to his reputation for talent and who yet was the one man best able to aid in the courts or before the assembly the suitors who required his opinion
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.68.2,indeed when he was afterwards himself tried for his life on the charge of having been concerned in setting up this very government when the four hundred were overthrown and hardly dealt with by the commons he made what would seem to be the best defence of any known up to my time
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.68.3,phrynichus also went beyond all others in his zeal for the oligarchy afraid of alcibiades and assured that he was no stranger to his intrigues with astyochus at samos he held that no oligarchy was ever likely to restore him and once embarked in the enterprise proved where danger was to be faced by far the staunchest of them all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.68.4,theramenes son of hagnon was also one of the foremost of the subverters of the democracy a man as able in council as in debate conducted by so many and by such sagacious heads the enterprise great as it was not unnaturally went forward although it was no light matter to deprive the athenian people of its freedom almost a hundred years after the deposition of the tyrants when it had been not only not subject to any during the whole of that period but accustomed during more than half of it to rule over subjects of its own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.69.1,the assembly ratified the proposed constitution without a single opposing voice and was then dissolved after which the four hundred were brought into the council chamber in the following way on account of the enemy at decelea all the athenians were constantly on the wall or in the ranks at the various military posts
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.69.2,on that day the persons not in the secret were allowed to go home as usual while orders were given to the accomplices of the conspirators to hang about without making any demonstration at some little distance from the posts and in case of any opposition to what was being done to seize the arms and put it down
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.69.3,there were also some andrians and tenians three hundred carystians and some of the settlers in aegina come with their own arms for this very purpose who had received similar instructions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.69.4,these dispositions completed the four hundred went each with a dagger concealed about his person accompanied by one hundred and twenty hellenic youths whom they employed wherever violence was needed and appeared before the councillors of the bean in the council chamber and told them to take their pay and be gone themselves bringing it for the whole of the residue of their term of office and giving it to them as they went out
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.70.1,upon the council withdrawing in this way without venturing any objection and the rest of the citizens making no movement the four hundred entered the council chamber and for the present contented themselves with drawing lots for their prytanes and making their prayers and sacrifices to the gods upon entering office but afterwards departed widely from the democratic system of government and except that on account of alcibiades they did not recall the exiles ruled the city by force
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.70.2,putting to death some men though not many whom they though it convenient to remove and imprisoning and banishing others they also sent to agis the lacedaemonian king at decelea to say that they desired to make peace and that he might reasonably be more disposed to treat now that he had them to deal with instead of the inconstant commons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.71.1,agis however did not believe in the tranquillity of the city or that the commons would thus in a moment give up their ancient liberty but thought that the sight of a large lacedaemonian force would be sufficient to excite them if they were not already in commotion of which he was by no means certain he accordingly gave to the envoys of the four hundred an answer which held out no hopes of an accommodation and sending for large reinforcements from peloponnese not long afterwards with these and his garrison from decelea descended to the very walls of athens hoping either that civil disturbances might help to subdue them to his terms or that in the confusion to be expected within and without the city they might even surrender without a blow being struck at all events he thought he would succeed in seizing the long walls bared of their defenders
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.71.2,however the athenians saw him come close up without making the least disturbance within the city and sending out their cavalry and a number of their heavy infantry light troops and archers shot down some of his soldiers who approached too near and got possession of some arms and dead upon this agis at last convinced led his army back again
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.71.3,and remaining with his own troops in the old position at decelea sent the reinforcement back home after a few days stay in attica after this the four hundred persevering sent another embassy to agis and now meeting with a better reception at his suggestion despatched envoys to lacedaemon to negotiate a treaty being desirous of making peace
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.72.1,they also sent ten men to samos to reassure the army and to explain that the oligarchy was not established for the hurt of the city or the citizens but for the salvation of the country at large and that there were five thousand not four hundred only concerned although what with their expeditions and employments abroad the athenians had never yet assembled to discuss a question important enough to bring five thousand of them together
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.72.2,the emissaries were also told what to say upon all other points and were so sent off immediately after the establishment of the new government which feared as it turned out justly that the mass of seamen would not be willing to remain under the oligarchical constitution and the evil beginning there might be the means of their overthrow
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.73.1,indeed at samos the question of the oligarchy had already entered upon a new phase the following events having taken place just at the time that the four hundred were conspiring
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.73.2,that part of the samian population which has been mentioned as rising against the upper class and as being the democratic party had now turned round and yielding to the solicitations of pisander during his visit and of the athenians in the conspiracy at samos had bound themselves by oaths to the number of three hundred and were about to fall upon the rest of their fellowcitizens whom they now in their turn regarded as the democratic party
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.73.3,meanwhile they put to death one hyperbolus an athenian a pestilent fellow that had been ostracised not from fear of his influence on position but because he was a rascal and a disgrace to the city being aided in this by charminus one of the generals and by some of the athenians with them to whom they had sworn friendship and with whom they perpetrated other acts of the kind and now determined to attack the people
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.73.4,the latter got wind of what was coming and told two of the generals leon and diomedon who on account of the credit which they enjoyed with the commons were unwilling supporters of the oligarchy and also thrasybulus and thrasyllus the former a captain of a galley the latter serving with the heavy infantry besides certain others who had ever been thought most opposed to the conspirators entreating them not to look on and see them destroyed and samos the sole remaining stay of their empire lost to the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.73.5,upon hearing this the persons whom they addressed now went round the soldiers one by one and urged them to resist especially the crew of the paralus which was made up entirely of athenians and freemen and had from time out of mind been enemies of oligarchy even when there was no such thing existing and leon and diomedon left behind some ships for their protection in case of their sailing away anywhere themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.73.6,accordingly when the three hundred attacked the people all these came to the rescue and foremost of all the crew of the paralus and the samian commons gained the victory and putting to death some thirty of the three hundred banishing three others of the ringleaders accorded an amnesty to the rest and lived together under a democratic government for the future
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.74.1,the ship paralus with chaereas son of archestratus on board an athenian who had taken an active part in the revolution was now without loss of time sent off by the samians and the army to athens to report what had occurred the fact that the four hundred were in power not being yet known
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.74.2,when they sailed into harbour the four hundred immediately arrested two or three of the parali and taking the vessel from the rest shifted them into a troopship and set them to keep guard round euboea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.74.3,chaereas however managed to secrete himself as soon as he saw how things stood and returning to samos drew a picture to the soldiers of the horrors enacting at athens in which everything was exaggerated saying that all were punished with stripes that no one could say a word against the holders of power that the soldiers wives and children were outraged and that it was intended to seize and shut up the relatives of all in the army at samos who were not of the government s way of thinking to be put to death in case of their disobedience besides a host of other injurious inventions
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.75.1,on hearing this the first thought of the army was to fall upon the chief authors of the oligarchy and upon all the rest concerned eventually however they desisted from this idea upon the men of moderate views opposing it and warning them against ruining their cause with the enemy close at hand and ready for battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.75.2,after this thrasybulus son of lycus and thrasyllus the chief leaders in the revolution now wishing in the most public manner to change the government at samos to a democracy bound all the soldiers by the most tremendous oaths and those of the oligarchical party more than any to accept a democratic government to be united to prosecute actively the war with the peloponnesians and to be enemies of the four hundred and to hold no communication with them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.75.3,the same oath was also taken by all the samians of full age and the soldiers associated the samians in all their affairs and in the fruits of their dangers having the conviction that there was no way of escape for themselves or for them but that success of the four hundred or of the enemy at miletus must be their ruin
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.1,the struggle now was between the army trying to force a democracy upon the city and the four hundred an oligarchy upon the camp
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.2,meanwhile the soldiers forthwith held an assembly in which they deposed the former generals and any of the captains whom they suspected and chose new captains and generals to replace them besides thrasybulus and thrasyllus whom they had already
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.3,they also stood up and encouraged one another and among other things urged that they ought not to lose heart because the city had revolted from them as the party seceding was smaller and in every way poorer in resources than themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.4,they had the whole fleet with which to compel the other cities in their empire to give them money just as if they had their base in the capital having a city in samos which so far from wanting strength had when at war been within an ace of depriving the athenians of the command of the sea while as far as the enemy was concerned they had the same base of operations as before indeed with the fleet in their hands they were better able to provide themselves with supplies than the government at home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.5,it was their advanced position at samos which had throughout enabled the home authorities to command the entrance into piraeus and if they refused to give them back the constitution they would now find that the army was more in a position to exclude them from the sea than they were to exclude the army
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.6,besides the city was of little or no use towards enabling them to overcome the enemy and they had lost nothing in losing those who had no longer either money to send them the soldiers having to find this for themselves or good counsel which entitles cities to direct armies on the contrary even in this the home government had done wrong in abolishing the institutions of their ancestors while the army maintained the said institutions and would try to force the home government to do so likewise so that even in point of good counsel the camp had as good counsellors as the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.76.7,moreover they had but to grant him security for his person and his recall and alcibiades would be only too glad to procure them the alliance of the king and above all if they failed altogether with the navy which they possessed they had numbers of places to retire to in which they would find cities and lands
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.77.1,debating together and comforting themselves after this manner they pushed on their war measures as actively as ever and the ten envoys sent to samos by the four hundred learning how matters stood while they were still at delos stayed quiet there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.78.1,about this time a cry arose among the soldiers in the peloponnesian fleet at miletus that astyochus and tissaphernes were ruining their cause astyochus had not been willing to fight at sea either before while they were still in full vigour and the fleet of the athenians small or now when the enemy was as they were informed in a state of sedition and his ships not yet united but kept them waiting for the phoenician fleet from tissaphernes which had only a nominal existence at the risk of wasting away in inactivity while tissaphernes not only did not bring up the fleet in question but was ruining their navy by payments made irregularly and even then not made in full they must therefore they insisted delay no longer but fight a decisive naval engagement the syracusans were the most urgent of any
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.79.1,the confederates and astyochus aware of these murmurs had already decided in council to fight a decisive battle and when the news reached them of the disturbance at samos they put to sea with all their ships one hundred and ten in number and ordering the milesians to move by land upon mycale set sail thither
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.79.2,the athenians with the eightytwo ships from samos were at the moment lying at glauce in mycale a point where samos approaches near to the continent and seeing the peloponnesian fleet sailing against them retired into samos not thinking themselves numerically strong enough to stake their all upon a battle
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.79.3,besides they had notice from miletus of the wish of the enemy to engage and were expecting to be joined from the hellespont by strombichides to whom a messenger had been already despatched with the ships that had gone from chios to abydos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.79.4,the athenians accordingly withdrew to samos and the peloponnesians put in at mycale and encamped with the land forces of the milesians and the people of the neighbourhood
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.79.5,the next day they were about to sail against samos when tidings reached them of the arrival of strombichides with the squadron from the hellespont upon which they immediately sailed back to miletus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.79.6,the athenians thus reinforced now in their turn sailed against miletus with a hundred and eight ships wishing to fight a decisive battle but as no one put out to meet them sailed back to samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.80.1,in the same summer immediately after this the peloponnesians having refused to fight with their fleet united through not thinking themselves a match for the enemy and being at a loss where to look for money for such a number of ships especially as tissaphernes proved so bad a paymaster sent off clearchus son of ramphias with forty ships to pharnabazus agreeably to the original instructions from peloponnese
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.80.2,pharnabazus inviting them and being prepared to furnish pay and byzantium besides sending offers to revolt to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.80.3,these peloponnesian ships accordingly put out into the open sea in order to escape the observation of the athenians and being overtaken by a storm the majority with clearchus got into delos and afterwards returned to miletus whence clearchus proceeded by land to the hellespont to take the command ten however of their number under the megarian helixus made good their passage to the hellespont and effected the revolt of byzantium
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.80.4,after this the commanders at samos were informed of it and sent a squadron against them to guard the hellespont and an encounter took place before byzantium between eight vessels on either side
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.81.1,meanwhile the chiefs at samos and especially thrasybulus who from the moment that he had changed the government had remained firmly resolved to recall alcibiades at last in an assembly brought over the mass of the soldiery and upon their voting for his recall and amnesty sailed over to tissaphernes and brought alcibiades to samos being convinced that their only chance of salvation lay in his bringing over tissaphernes from the peloponnesians to themselves
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.81.2,an assembly was then held in which alcibiades complained of and deplored his private misfortune in having been banished and speaking at great length upon public affairs highly incited their hopes for the future and extravagantly magnified his own influence with tissaphernes his object in this was to make the oligarchical government at athens afraid of him to hasten the dissolution of the clubs to increase his credit with the army at samos and heighten their own confidence and lastly to prejudice the enemy as strongly as possible against tissaphernes and blast the hopes which they entertained
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.81.3,alcibiades accordingly held out to the army such extravagant promises as the following that tissaphernes had solemnly assured him that if he could only trust the athenians they should never want for supplies while he had anything left no not even if he should have to coin his own silver couch and that he would bring the phoenician fleet now at aspendus to the athenians instead of to the peloponnesians but that he could only trust the athenians if alcibiades were recalled to be his security for them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.82.1,upon hearing this and much more besides the athenians at once elected him general together with the former ones and put all their affairs into his hands there was now not a man in the army who would have exchanged his present hopes of safety and vengeance upon the four hundred for any consideration whatever and after what they had been told they were now inclined to disdain the enemy before them and to sail at once for piraeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.82.2,to the plan of sailing for piraeus leaving their more immediate enemies behind them alcibiades opposed the most positive refusal in spite of the numbers that insisted upon it saying that now that he had been elected general he would first sail to tissaphernes and concert with him measures for carrying on the war
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.82.3,accordingly upon leaving this assembly he immediately took his departure in order to have it thought that there was an entire confidence between them and also wishing to increase his consideration with tissaphernes and to show that he had now been elected general and was in a position to do him good or evil as he chose thus managing to frighten the athenians with tissaphernes and tissaphernes with the athenians
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.83.1,meanwhile the peloponnesians at miletus heard of the recall of alcibiades and already distrustful of tissaphernes now became far more disgusted with him than ever
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.83.2,indeed after their refusal to go out and give battle to the athenians when they appeared before miletus tissaphernes had grown slacker than ever in his payments and even before this on account of alcibiades his unpopularity had been on the increase
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.83.3,gathering together just as before the soldiers and some persons of consideration besides the soldiery began to reckon up how they had never yet received their pay in full that what they did receive was small in quantity and even that paid irregularly and that unless they fought a decisive battle or removed to some station where they could get supplies the ships crews would desert and that it was all the fault of astyochus who humoured tissaphernes for his own private advantage
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.84.1,the army was engaged in these reflections when the following disturbance took place about the person of astyochus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.84.2,most of the syracusan and thurian sailors were freemen and these the freest crews in the armament were likewise the boldest in setting upon astyochus and demanding their pay the latter answered somewhat stiffly and threatened them and when dorieus spoke up for his own sailors even went so far as to lift his baton against him
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.84.3,upon seeing which the mass of the men in sailor fashion rushed in a fury to strike astyochus he however saw them in time and fled for refuge to an altar and they were thus parted without his being struck
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.84.4,meanwhile the fort built by tissaphernes in miletus was surprised and taken by the milesians and the garrison in it turned out an act which met with the approval of the rest of the allies and in particular of the syracusans
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.84.5,but which found no favour with lichas who said moreover that the milesians and the rest in the king s country ought to show a reasonable submission to tissaphernes and to pay him court until the war should be happily settled the milesians were angry with him for this and for other things of the kind and upon his afterwards dying of sickness would not allow him to be buried where the lacedaemonians with the army desired
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.85.1,the discontent of the army with astyochus and tissaphernes had reached this pitch when mindarus arrived from lacedaemon to succeed astyochus as admiral and assumed the command astyochus now set sail for home
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.85.2,and tissaphernes sent with him one of his confidants gaulites a carian who spoke the two languages to complain of the milesians for the affair of the fort and at the same time to defend himself against the milesians who were as he was aware on their way to sparta chiefly to denounce his conduct and had with them hermocrates who was to accuse tissaphernes of joining with alcibiades to ruin the peloponnesian cause and of playing a double game
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.85.3,indeed hermocrates had always been at enmity with him about the pay not being restored in full and eventually when he was banished from syracuse and new commanders potamis myscon and demarchus had come out to miletus to the ships of the syracusans tissaphernes pressed harder than ever upon him in his exile and among other charges against him accused him of having once asked him for money and then given himself out as his enemy because he failed to obtain it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.85.4,while astyochus and the milesians and hermocrates made sail for lacedaemon alcibiades had now crossed back from tissaphernes to samos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.1,after his return the envoys of the four hundred sent as has been mentioned above to pacify and explain matters to the forces at samos arrived from delos and an assembly was held in which they attempted to speak
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.2,the soldiers at first would not hear them and cried out to put to death the subverters of the democracy but at last after some difficulty calmed down and gave them a hearing
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.3,upon this the envoys proceeded to inform them that the recent change had been made to save the city and not to ruin it or to deliver it over to the enemy for they had already had an opportunity of doing this when he invaded the country during their government that all the five thousand would have their proper share in the government and that their hearers relatives had neither outrage as chaereas had slanderously reported nor other illtreatment to complain of but were all in undisturbed enjoyment of their property just as they had left them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.4,besides these they made a number of other statements which had no better success with their angry auditors and amid a host of different opinions the one which found most favour was that of sailing to piraeus now it was that alcibiades for the first time did the state a service and one of the most signal kind for when the athenians at samos were bent upon sailing against their countrymen in which case ionia and the hellespont would most certainly at once have passed into possession of the enemy alcibiades it was who prevented them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.5,at that moment when no other man would have been able to hold back the multitude he put a stop to the intended expedition and rebuked and turned aside the resentment felt on personal grounds against the envoys
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.6,he dismissed them with an answer from himself to the effect that he did not object to the government of the five thousand but insisted that the four hundred should be deposed and the council of five hundred reinstated in power meanwhile any retrenchments for economy by which pay might be better found for the armament met with his entire approval
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.7,generally he bade them hold out and show a bold face to the enemy since if the city were saved there was good hope that the two parties might some day be reconciled whereas if either were once destroyed that at samos or that at athens there would no longer be any one to be reconciled to
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.8,meanwhile arrived envoys from the argives with offers of support to the athenian commons at samos these were thanked by alcibiades and dismissed with a request to come when called upon
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.86.9,the argives were accompanied by the crew of the paralus whom we left placed in a troopship by the four hundred with orders to cruise round euboea and who being employed to carry to lacedaemon some athenian envoys sent by the four hundred laespodias aristophon and melesias as they sailed by argos laid hands upon the envoys and delivering them over to the argives as the chief subverters of the democracy themselves instead of returning to athens took the argive envoys on board and came to samos in the galley which had been confided to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.87.1,the same summer at the time that the return of alcibiades coupled with the general conduct of tissaphernes had carried to its height the discontent of the peloponnesians who no longer entertained any doubt of his having joined the athenians tissaphernes wishing it would seem to clear himself to them of these charges prepared to go after the phoenician fleet to aspendus and invited lichas to go with him saying that he would appoint tamos as his lieutenant to provide pay for the armament during his own absence
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.87.2,accounts differ and it is not easy to ascertain with what intention he went to aspendus and did not bring the fleet after all
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.87.3,that one hundred and fortyseven phoenician ships came as far as aspendus is certain but why they did not come on has been variously accounted for some think that he went away in pursuance of his plan of wasting the peloponnesian resources since at any rate tamos his lieutenant far from being any better proved a worse paymaster than himself others that he brought the phoenicians to aspendus to exact money from them for their discharge having never intended to employ them others again that it was in view of the outcry against him at lacedaemon in order that it might be said that he was not in fault but that the ships were really manned and that he had certainly gone to fetch them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.87.4,to myself it seems only too evident that he did not bring up the fleet because he wished to wear out and paralyse the hellenic forces that is to waste their strength by the time lost during his journey to aspendus and to keep them evenly balanced by not throwing his weight into either scale had he wished to finish the war he could have done so assuming of course that he made his appearance in a way which left no room for doubt as by bringing up the fleet he would in all probability have given the victory to the lacedaemonians whose navy even as it was faced the athenian more as an equal than as an inferior
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.87.5,but what convicts him most clearly is the excuse which he put forward for not bringing the ships he said that the number assembled was less than the king had ordered but surely it would only have enhanced his credit if he spent little of the king s money and effected the same end at less cost
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.87.6,in any case whatever was his intention tissaphernes went to aspendus and saw the phoenicians and the peloponnesians at his desire sent a lacedaemonian called philip with two galleys to fetch the fleet
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.88.1,alcibiades finding that tissaphernes had gone to aspendus himself sailed thither with thirteen ships promising to do a great and certain service to the athenians at samos as he would either bring the phoenician fleet to the athenians or at all events prevent its joining the peloponnesians in all probability he had long known that tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all and wished to compromise him as much as possible in the eyes of the peloponnesians through his apparent friendship for himself and the athenians and thus in a manner to oblige him to join their side while alcibiades weighed anchor and sailed eastward straight for phaselis and caunus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.89.1,the envoys sent by the four hundred to samos arrived at athens upon their delivering the message from alcibiades telling them to hold out and to show a firm front to the enemy and saying that he had great hopes of reconciling them with the army and of overcoming the peloponnesians the majority of the members of the oligarchy who were already discontented and only too much inclined to be quit of the business in any safe way that they could were at once greatly strengthened in their resolve
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.89.2,these now banded together and strongly criticised the administration their leaders being some of the principal generals and men in office under the oligarchy such as theramenes son of hagnon aristocrates son of scellias and others who although among the most prominent members of the government being afraid as they said of the army at samos and most especially of alcibiades and also lest the envoys whom they had sent to lacedaemon might do the state some harm without the authority of the people without insisting on objections to the excessive concentration of power in a few hands yet urged that the five thousand must be shown to exist not merely in name but in reality and the constitution placed upon a fairer basis
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.89.3,but this was merely their political cry most of them being driven by private ambition into the line of conduct so surely fatal to oligarchies that arise out of democracies for all at once pretend to be not only equals but each the chief and master of his fellows while under a democracy a disappointed candidate accepts his defeat more easily because he has not the humiliation of being beaten by his equals
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.89.4,but what most clearly encouraged the malcontents was the power of alcibiades at samos and their own disbelief in the stability of the oligarchy and it was now a race between them as to which should first become the leader of the commons
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.90.1,meanwhile the leaders and members of the four hundred most opposed to a democratic form of government phrynichus who had had the quarrel with alcibiades during his command at samos aristarchus the bitter and inveterate enemy of the commons and pisander and antiphon and others of the chiefs who already as soon as they entered upon power and again when the army at samos seceded from them and declared for a democracy had sent envoys from their own body to lacedaemon and made every effort for peace and had built the wall in eetionia now redoubled their exertions when their envoys returned from samos and they saw not only the people but their own most trusted associates turning against them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.90.2,alarmed at the state of things at athens as at samos they now sent off in haste antiphon and phrynichus and ten others with injunctions to make peace with lacedaemon upon any terms no matter what that should be at all tolerable
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.90.3,meanwhile they pushed on more actively than ever with the wall in eetionia now the meaning of this wall according to theramenes and his supporters was not so much to keep out the army of samos in case of its trying to force its way into piraeus as to be able to let in at pleasure the fleet and army of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.90.4,for eetionia is a mole of piraeus close alongside of the entrance of the harbour and was now fortified in connection with the wall already existing on the land side so that a few men placed in it might be able to command the entrance the old wall on the land side and the new one now being built within on the side of the sea both ending in one of the two towers standing at the narrow mouth of the harbour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.90.5,they also walled off the largest porch in piraeus which was in immediate connection with this wall and kept it in their own hands compelling all to unload there the corn that came into the harbour and what they had in stock and to take it out from thence when they sold it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.91.1,these measures had long provoked the murmurs of theramenes and when the envoys returned from lacedaemon without having effected any general pacification he affirmed that this wall was like to prove the ruin of the state
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.91.2,at this moment fortytwo ships from peloponnese including some siceliot and italiot vessels from locri and tarentum had been invited over by the euboeans and were already riding off las in laconia preparing for the voyage to euboea under the command of agesandridas son of agesander a spartan theramenes now affirmed that this squadron was destined not so much to aid euboea as the party fortifying eetionia and that unless precautions were speedily taken the city would be surprised and lost
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.91.3,this was no mere calumny there being really some such plan entertained by the accused their first wish was to have the oligarchy without giving up the empire failing this to keep their ships and walls and be independent while if this also were denied them sooner than be the first victims of the restored democracy they were resolved to call in the enemy and make peace give up their walls and ships and at all costs retain possession of the government if their lives were only assured to them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.1,for this reason they pushed forward the construction of their work with posterns and entrances and means of introducing the enemy being eager to have it finished in time
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.2,meanwhile the murmurs against them were at first confined to a few persons and went on in secret until phrynichus after his return from the embassy to lacedaemon was laid wait for and stabbed in full market by one of the peripoli falling down dead before he had gone far from the council chamber the assassin escaped but his accomplice an argive was taken and put to the torture by the four hundred without their being able to extract from him the name of his employer or anything further than that he knew of many men who used to assemble at the house of the commander of the peripoli and at other houses here the matter was allowed to drop this so emboldened theramenes and aristocrates and the rest of their partisans in the four hundred and out of doors that they now resolved to act
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.3,for by this time the ships had sailed round from las and anchoring at epidaurus had overrun aegina and theramenes asserted that being bound for euboea they would never have sailed in to lacedae and come back to anchor at epidaurus unless they had been invited to come to aid in the designs of which he had always accused the government further inaction had therefore now become impossible
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.4,in the end after a great many seditious harangues and suspicions they set to work in real earnest the heavy infantry in piraeus building the wall in eetionia among whom was aristocrates a colonel with his own tribe laid hands upon alexicles a general under the oligarchy and the devoted adherent of the cabal and took him into a house and confined him there
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.5,in this they were assisted by one hermon commander of the peripoli in munychia and others and above all had with them the great bulk of the heavy infantry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.6,as soon as the news reached the four hundred who happened to be sitting in the council chamber all except the disaffected wished at once to go to the posts where the arms were and menaced theramenes and his party theramenes defended himself and said that he was ready immediately to go and help to rescue alexicles and taking with him one of the generals belonging to his party went down to piraeus followed by aristarchus and some young men of the cavalry
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.7,all was now panic and confusion those in the city imagined that piraeus was already taken and the prisoner put to death while those in piraeus expected every moment to be attacked by the party in the city
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.8,the older men however stopped the persons running up and down the town and making for the stands of arms and thucydides the pharsalian proxenus of the city came forward and threw himself in the way of the rival factions and appealed to them not to ruin the state while the enemy was still at hand waiting for his opportunity and so at length succeeded in quieting them and in keeping their hands off each other
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.9,meanwhile theramenes came down to piraeus being himself one of the generals and raged and stormed against the heavy infantry while aristarchus and the adversaries of the people were angry in right earnest
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.10,most of the heavy infantry however went on with the business without faltering and asked theramenes if he thought the wall had been constructed for any good purpose and whether it would not be better that it should be pulled down to this he answered that if they thought it best to pull it down he for his part agreed with them upon this the heavy infantry and a number of the people in piraeus immediately got up on the fortification and began to demolish it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.92.11,now their cry to the multitude was that all should join in the work who wished the five thousand to govern instead of the four hundred for instead of saying in so many words all who wished the commons to govern they still disguised themselves under the name of the five thousand being afraid that these might really exist and that they might be speaking to one of their number and get into trouble through ignorance indeed this was why the four hundred neither wished the five thousand to exist nor to have it known that they did not exist being of opinion that to give themselves so many partners in empire would be downright democracy while the mystery in question would make the people afraid of one another
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.93.1,the next day the four hundred although alarmed nevertheless assembled in the council chamber while the heavy infantry in piraeus after having released their prisoner alexicles and pulled down the fortification went with their arms to the theatre of dionysus close to munychia and there held an assembly in which they decided to march into the city and setting forth accordingly halted in the anaceum
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.93.2,here they were joined by some delegates from the four hundred who reasoned with them one by one and persuaded those whom they saw to be the most moderate to remain quiet themselves and to keep in the rest saying that they would make known the five thousand and have the four hundred chosen from them in rotation as should be decided by the five thousand and meanwhile entreated them not to ruin the state or drive it into the arms of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.93.3,after a great many had spoken and had been spoken to the whole body of heavy infantry became calmer than before absorbed by their fears for the country at large and now agreed to hold upon an appointed day an assembly in the theatre of dionysus for the restoration of concord
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.94.1,when the day came for the assembly in the theatre and they were upon the point of assembling news arrived that the fortytwo ships under agesandridas were sailing from megara along the coast of salamis the people to a man now thought that it was just what theramenes and his party had so often said that the ships were sailing to the fortification and concluded that they had done well to demolish it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.94.2,but though it may possibly have been by appointment that agesandridas hovered about epidaurus and the neighbourhood he would also naturally be kept there by the hope of an opportunity arising out of the troubles in the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.94.3,in any case the athenians on receipt of the news immediately ran down in mass to piraeus seeing themselves threatened by the enemy with a worse war than their war among themselves not at a distance but close to the harbour of athens some went on board the ships already afloat while others launched fresh vessels or ran to defend the walls and the mouth of the harbour
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.1,meanwhile the peloponnesian vessels sailed by and rounding sunium anchored between thoricus and prasiae and afterwards arrived at oropus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.2,the athenians with revolution in the city and unwilling to lose a moment in going to the relief of their most important possession for euboea was everything to them now that they were shut out from attica were compelled to put to sea in haste and with untrained crews and sent thymochares with some vessels to eretria
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.3,these upon their arrival with the ships already in euboea made up a total of thirtysix vessels and were immediately forced to engage for agesandridas after his crews had dined put out from oropus which is about seven miles from eretria by sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.4,and the athenians seeing him sailing up immediately began to man their vessels the sailors however instead of being by their ships as they supposed were gone away to purchase provisions for their dinner in the houses in the outskirts of the town the eretrians having so arranged that there should be nothing on sale in the marketplace in order that the athenians might be a long time in manning their ships and the enemy s attack taking them by surprise might be compelled to put to sea just as they were a signal also was raised in eretria to give them notice in oropus when to put to sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.5,the athenians forced to put out so poorly prepared engaged off the harbour of eretria and after holding their own for some little while notwithstanding were at length put to flight and chased to the shore
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.6,such of their number as took refuge in eretria which they presumed to be friendly to them found their fate in that city being butchered by the inhabitants while those who fled to the athenian fort in the eretrian territory and the vessels which got to chalcis were saved
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.95.7,the peloponnesians after taking twentytwo athenian ships and killing or making prisoners of the crews set up a trophy and not long afterwards effected the revolt of the whole of euboea except oreus which was held by the athenians themselves and made a general settlement of the affairs of the island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.96.1,when the news of what had happened in euboea reached athens a panic ensued such as they had never before known neither the disaster in sicily great as it seemed at the time nor any other had ever so much alarmed them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.96.2,the camp at samos was in revolt they had no more ships or men to man them they were at discord among themselves and might at any moment come to blows and a disaster of this magnitude coming on the top of all by which they lost their fleet and worst of all euboea which was of more value to them than attica could not occur without throwing them into the deepest despondency
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.96.3,meanwhile their greatest and most immediate trouble was the possibility that the enemy emboldened by his victory might make straight for them and sail against piraeus which they had no longer ships to defend and every moment they expected him to arrive
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.96.4,this with a little more courage he might easily have done in which case he would either have increased the dissensions of the city by his presence or if he had stayed to besiege it have compelled the fleet from ionia although the enemy of the oligarchy to come to the rescue of their country and of their relatives and in the meantime would have become master of the hellespont ionia the islands and of everything as far as euboea or to speak roundly of the whole athenian empire
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.96.5,but here as on so many other occasions the lacedaemonians proved the most convenient people in the world for the athenians to be at war with the wide difference between the two characters the slowness and want of energy of the lacedaemonians as contrasted with the dash and enterprise of their opponents proved of the greatest service especially to a maritime empire like athens indeed this was shown by the syracusans who were most like the athenians in character and also most successful in combating them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.97.1,nevertheless upon receipt of the news the athenians manned twenty ships and called immediately a first assembly in the pnyx where they had been used to meet formerly and deposed the four hundred and voted to hand over the government to the five thousand of which body all who furnished a suit of armour were to be members decreeing also that no one should receive pay for the discharge of any office
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.97.2,or if he did should be held accursed many other assemblies were held afterwards in which lawmakers were elected and all other measures taken to form a constitution it was during the first period of this constitution that the athenians appear to have enjoyed the best government that they ever did at least in my time for the fusion of the high and the low was effected with judgment and this was what first enabled the state to raise up her head after her manifold disasters
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.97.3,they also voted for the recall of alcibiades and of other exiles and sent to him and to the camp at samos and urged them to devote themselves vigorously to the war

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.98.3,after communicating with them aristarchus deceived the garrison in oenoe by telling them that their countrymen in the city had compounded with the lacedaemonians and that one of the terms of the capitulation was that they must surrender the place to the boeotians the garrison believed him as he was general and besides knew nothing of what had occurred owing to the siege and so evacuated the fort under truce

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.100.2,but learning that he was at chios and expecting that he would stay there he posted scouts in lesbos and on the continent opposite to prevent the fleet moving without his knowing it and himself coasted along to methymna and gave orders to prepare meal and other necessaries in order to attack them from lesbos in the event of their remaining for any length of time at chios

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.100.4,thrasyllus accordingly determined to go there with all his ships and to attack the place meanwhile thrasybulus had preceded him thither with five ships from samos as soon as he heard that the exiles had crossed over and coming too late to save eresus went on and anchored before the town
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.100.5,here they were joined also by two vessels on their way home from the hellespont and by the ships of the methymnians making a grand total of sixtyseven vessels and the forces on board now made ready with engines and every other means available to do their utmost to storm eresus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.101.1,in the meantime mindarus and the peloponnesian fleet at chios after taking provisions for two days and receiving three chian pieces of money for each man from the chians on the third day put out in haste from the island in order to avoid falling in with the ships at eresus they did not make for the open sea but keeping lesbos on their left sailed for the continent
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.101.2,after touching at the port of carteria in the phocaeid and dining they went on along the cumaean coast and supped at arginusae on the continent over against mitylene
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.101.3,from thence they continued their voyage along the coast although it was late in the night and arriving at harmatus on the continent opposite methymna dined there and swiftly passing lectum larisa hamaxitus and the neighbouring towns arrived a little before midnight at rhoeteum here they were now in the hellespont some of the ships also put in at sigeum and at other places in the neighbourhood
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.102.1,meanwhile the warnings of the firesignals and the sudden increase in the number of fires on the enemy s shore informed the eighteen athenian ships at sestos of the approach of the peloponnesian fleet that very night they set sail in haste just as they were and hugging the shore of the chersonese coasted along to elaeus in order to sail out into the open sea away from the fleet of the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.102.2,after passing unobserved the sixteen ships at abydos which had nevertheless been warned by their approaching friends to be on the alert to prevent their sailing out at dawn they sighted the fleet of mindarus which immediately gave chase all had not time to get away the greater number however escaped to imbros and lemnos while four of the hindmost were overtaken off elaeus
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.102.3,one of these was stranded opposite to the temple of protesilaus and taken with its crew two others without their crews the fourth was abandoned on the shore of imbros and burned by the enemy
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.103.1,after this the peloponnesians were joined by the squadron from abydos which made up their fleet to a grand total of eightysix vessels they spent the day in unsuccessfully besieging elaeus and then sailed back to abydos
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.103.2,meanwhile the athenians deceived by their scouts and never dreaming of the enemy s fleet getting by undetected were tranquilly besieging eresus as soon as they heard the news they instantly abandoned eresus and made with all speed for the hellespont
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.103.3,and after taking two of the peloponnesian ships which had been carried out too far into the open sea in the ardour of the pursuit and now fell in their way the next day dropped anchor at elaeus and bringing back the ships that had taken refuge at imbros during five days prepared for the coming engagement
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.104.1,after this they engaged in the following way the athenians formed in column and sailed close along shore to sestos upon perceiving which the peloponnesians put out from abydos to meet them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.104.2,realising that a battle was now imminent both combatants extended their flank the athenians along the chersonese from idacus to arrhiani with seventysix ships the peloponnesians from abydos to dardanus with eightysix

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.104.4,the peloponnesians hastened to engage first and outflanking with their left the athenian right sought to cut them off if possible from sailing out of the straits and to drive their centre upon the shore which was not far off the athenians perceiving their intention extended their own wing and outsailed them
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.104.5,while their left had by this time passed the point of cynossema this however obliged them to thin and weaken their centre especially as they had fewer ships than the enemy and as the coast round point cynossema formed a sharp angle which prevented their seeing what was going on on the other side of it
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.105.1,the peloponnesians now attacked their centre and drove ashore the ships of the athenians and disembarked to follow up their victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.105.2,no help could be given to the centre either by the squadron of thrasybulus on the right on account of the number of ships attacking him or by that of thrasyllus on the left from whom the point of cynossema hid what was going on and who was also hindered by his syracusan and other opponents whose numbers were fully equal to his own at length however the peloponnesians in the confidence of victory began to scatter in pursuit of the ships of the enemy and allowed a considerable part of their fleet to get into disorder
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.105.3,on seeing this the squadron of thrasybulus discontinued their lateral movement and facing about attacked and routed the ships opposed to them and next fell roughly upon the scattered vessels of the victorious peloponnesian division and put most of them to flight without a blow the syracusans also had by this time given way before the squadron of thrasyllus and now openly took to flight upon seeing the flight of their comrades
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.106.1,the rout was now complete most of the peloponnesians fled for refuge first to the river midius and afterwards to abydos only a few ships were taken by the athenians as owing to the narrowness of the hellespont the enemy had not far to go to be in safety nevertheless nothing could have been more opportune for them than this victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.106.2,up to this time they had feared the peloponnesian fleet owing to a number of petty losses and to the disaster in sicily but they now ceased to mistrust themselves or any longer to think their enemies good for anything at sea
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.106.3,meanwhile they took from the enemy eight chian vessels five corinthian two ambraciot two boeotian one leucadian lacedaemonian syracusan and pellenian losing fifteen of their own
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.106.4,after setting up a trophy upon point cynossema securing the wrecks and restoring to the enemy his dead under truce they sent off a galley to athens with the news of their victory
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.106.5,the arrival of this vessel with its unhopedfor good news after the recent disasters of euboea and in the revolution at athens gave fresh courage to the athenians and caused them to believe that if they put their shoulders to the wheel their cause might yet prevail
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.107.1,on the fourth day after the seafight the athenians in sestos having hastily refitted their ships sailed against cyzicus which had revolted off harpagium and priapus they sighted at anchor the eight vessels from byzantium and sailing up and routing the troops on shore took the ships and then went on and recovered the town of cyzicus which was unfortified and levied money from the citizens
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.107.2,in the meantime the peloponesians sailed from abydos to elaeus and recovered such of their captured galleys as were still uninjured the rest having been burned by the elaeusians and sent hippocrates and epicles to euboea to fetch the squadron from that island
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.108.1,about the same time alcibiades returned with his thirteen ships from caunus and phaselis to samos bringing word that he had prevented the phoenician fleet from joining the peloponnesians and had made tissaphernes more friendly to the athenians than before
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.108.2,alcibiades now manned nine more ships and levied large sums of money from the halicarnassians and fortified cos after doing this and placing a governor in cos he sailed back to samos autumn being now at hand

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.108.4,while the peloponnesians were in the hellespont the antandrians a people of aeolic extraction conveyed by land across mount ida some heavy infantry from abydos and introduced them into the town having been illtreated by arsaces the persian lieutenant of tissaphernes this same arsaces had upon pretence of a secret quarrel invited the chief men of the delians to undertake military service these were delians who had settled at atramyttium after having been driven from their homes by the athenians for the sake of purifying delos and after drawing them out from their town as his friends and allies had laid wait for them at dinner and surrounded them and caused them to be shot down by his soldiers
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.108.5,this deed made the antandrians fear that he might some day do them some mischief and as he also laid upon them burdens too heavy for them to bear they expelled his garrison from their citadel
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:8.109.1,tissaphernes upon hearing of this act of the peloponnesians in addition to what had occurred at miletus and cnidus where his garrisons had been also expelled now saw that the breach between them was serious and fearing further injury from them and being also vexed to think that pharnabazus should receive them and in less time and at less cost perhaps succeed better against athens than he had done determined to rejoin them in the hellespont in order to complain of the events at antandros and excuse himself as best he could in the matter of the phoenician fleet and of the other charges against him accordingly he went first to ephesus and offered sacrifice to artemis
